Are you a software engineer?

Bragdoc makes it easy to track your work achievements via the UI and the chat interface, but if you're a software developer, chances are that most of your work is already documented in your git history. So what if we could turn your git history into achievements automatically, without you having to spend hours tracking them down?

That's where the bragdoc CLI comes in: a simple tool that grabs your commit history and extracts the achievements for you. Just install the CLI globally with `npm install -g @bragdoc/cli`, login with `bragdoc login`, and you're ready to go:

```bash
> npm install -g @bragdoc/cli

> bragdoc login

Logging in to bragdoc.ai...
Logged in successfully

> bragdoc repos add .
Added repository: âœ“ (/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc-ai) [max: 300]

> bragdoc extract

Collecting commits from edspencer/bragdoc-ai (branch: cli)...

```

With one command we just pulled 12 commits worth of achievements out of git history and into your brag document. The CLI tool keeps track of what it's already processed - in the example above 13 out of 25 commits were already processed so were skipped.

For software engineers this makes it really easy to just run a command and know it's going to automatically pull out the work you've done on it automatically, saving you time but also ensuring you don't miss anything important.

If your performance review is next week and you haven't kept good records of your work accomplishments, the bragdoc CLI tool can scan back as far as you like and pull out everything you did. Basic plan users can use it for a single repo, while pro users can use it on up to 25.
