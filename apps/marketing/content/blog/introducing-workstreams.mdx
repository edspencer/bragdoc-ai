# Automatic grouping of your Achievements

You've been tracking your Achievements in Bragdoc, maybe dozens of them by now. But when it's time to write your self-review or update your resume, you're still staring at a long list trying to figure out what story it tells.

Today we're launching **Workstreams** — a feature that automatically discovers the themes and patterns in your work.

## What Are Workstreams?

Workstreams are AI-generated clusters of related achievements. Instead of a chronological list, you see your work organized by what it actually represents:

- **Backend Performance Optimization** — 8 achievements
- **Team Leadership & Mentoring** — 12 achievements
- **API Design & Integration** — 6 achievements

Each workstream tells a story about a theme in your career. The groupings happen automatically based on what your achievements are actually about, not just when you did them or which project they belonged to.

## Why This Matters

**Performance reviews become easier.** 6 months worth of Achievements can be overwhelming, but Workstreams put them each into context. Each workstream becomes a talking point. You can immediately see where you've been spending your time and what impact you've had in each area.

**Career patterns become visible.** Are you becoming more specialized or more generalist? Are you developing the skills you want to grow? Workstreams show you the actual shape of your work over time.

**Your story writes itself.** When someone asks "what have you been working on?", you have a real answer. Not a list of tasks, but a narrative about the themes that define your contributions.

## Better Performance Reviews

The creation of Workstreams helps you better prepare for Performance Reviews by providing clear context about how all of your hundreds of Achievements this year fit into the themes that define your contributions. Seeing the wood through the trees is the first step in writing a great self-review.

  BragDoc's Performance Reviews feature builds on Workstreams to automatically generate self-reviews.

Next week, we'll be launching the first version of the bragdoc.ai Performance Reviews tool, which builds on Workstreams and automatically creates excellent self-reviews to support your next Performance Review.

The documents it creates can be completely personalized to how your company does performance reviews, and you can create as many Performance Reviews as you want, with each one aware of and able to refer back to the last. More to come next week!

## Try It Now

Workstreams are available to all BragDoc users with 20 or more achievements. Just click "Generate Workstreams" in your dashboard and watch as your achievements organize themselves into meaningful groups.
