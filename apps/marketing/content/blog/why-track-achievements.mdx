# Why Every Developer Should Track Their Achievements

If you're a developer, you've probably experienced this: It's performance review time, and your manager asks you to list your accomplishments from the past year. You stare at a blank document, struggling to remember what you actually did.

This is a common problem, and it's costing developers promotions, raises, and career opportunities.

## The Forgetting Curve

Research shows that we forget 50% of new information within an hour, and 90% within a week. When it comes to our daily work, we're constantly moving from one task to the next, rarely taking time to document what we've accomplished.

By the time performance review season rolls around, most of your achievements have been forgotten.

## The Career Impact

Not tracking your achievements can hurt your career in several ways:

### 1. Performance Reviews

Without a clear record of your accomplishments, you're at a disadvantage during performance reviews. You might undersell your contributions or forget important projects entirely.

### 2. Job Interviews

When interviewing for new positions, you need concrete examples of your work. "I worked on various features" is much less compelling than "I reduced API response time by 40%, improving user experience for 100,000+ daily active users."

### 3. Salary Negotiations

Data beats feelings. When negotiating salary, having a documented track record of your impact gives you leverage. You can point to specific achievements and their business value.

### 4. Imposter Syndrome

Many developers struggle with imposter syndrome. Having a record of your achievements can help combat these feelings by providing concrete evidence of your skills and contributions.

## What Should You Track?

Not all work is created equal. Focus on tracking:

- **Impact**: What was the business or technical impact of your work?
- **Scale**: How many users, systems, or team members were affected?
- **Challenges**: What obstacles did you overcome?
- **Leadership**: Did you mentor others, lead initiatives, or improve processes?
- **Technical Growth**: What new skills or technologies did you learn?

## The Traditional Approach (And Why It Fails)

Many people try to track achievements manually:

- Keeping a "brag document" in Google Docs
- Writing weekly summaries in a journal
- Maintaining a running list in a notes app

The problem? **It requires discipline and time.** Most developers are too busy shipping code to remember to update their brag doc regularly.

## The Automated Approach

This is where BragDoc comes in. Instead of manually tracking achievements, BragDoc automatically extracts them from your git commits using AI.

You keep coding as usual, and BragDoc builds your achievement history in the background. When you need it for a performance review or interview, it's already there.

## Getting Started

Ready to start tracking your achievements? Here's a simple approach:

1. **Start today**: Don't wait for the "perfect" system. Start with whatever tool you have.
2. **Make it automatic**: Use tools like BragDoc that integrate with your existing workflow.
3. **Review regularly**: Set a monthly reminder to review and refine your achievements.
4. **Focus on impact**: Always tie your work to business or technical outcomes.

Your future self will thank you.
