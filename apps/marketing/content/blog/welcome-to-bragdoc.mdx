# Welcome to BragDoc

We're excited to introduce **BragDoc** - an AI-powered achievement tracking platform designed specifically for developers and knowledge workers who want to advance their careers without the hassle of manual tracking.

## The Problem We're Solving

As developers, our work is often invisible. We ship features, fix bugs, improve performance, and mentor teammates - but when it comes time for performance reviews or updating our resumes, we struggle to remember what we actually accomplished.

Sound familiar? You're not alone. This is a problem that affects millions of knowledge workers worldwide.

## How BragDoc Works

BragDoc solves this problem with a simple two-part system:

### 1. CLI Tool (Your Machine)

Install our CLI tool and it automatically extracts achievements from your git commits:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g bragdoc-cli
bragdoc init
bragdoc extract
\`\`\`

Your code **never leaves your machine**. The CLI uses your own LLM (including free local options like Ollama) to analyze commits and generate achievement summaries.

### 2. Web App (BragDoc Cloud)

The web app stores your achievement summaries (not your code) and helps you:

- Review and organize achievements
- Generate documents for performance reviews
- Prepare for standups and 1-on-1s
- Track your career growth over time

## Privacy First

We take privacy seriously. Your source code never leaves your machine. Only the AI-generated achievement summaries are stored in our cloud, and you can even run BragDoc 100% offline if you prefer.
