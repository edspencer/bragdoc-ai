Not all developer impact looks the same. You might spend a month shipping a major feature, then spend the next month mentoring a junior developer, then spend a week debugging a critical production issue. Each contribution is valuable. Each requires different documentation strategies.

Most developers document only one type of impact well: the code they ship. Everything else—the mentoring, the architecture decisions, the process improvements—gets lost because they don't know how to capture it.

Your [performance review](/use-cases) should reflect the full scope of your contributions. Here's how to document each type of impact effectively.

![The 6 Types of Developer Impact: Code & Features, Mentoring, Architecture, Process, Reliability, and Collaboration](/images/blog/six-types-developer-impact/six-types-infographic.svg)

## 1. Code & Features: Shipping Functionality

**What it is:** The features you build, the bugs you fix, the technical work that ships to production.

**Why it matters:** This is the most visible work. It's what users see, what product teams request, and what leadership tracks.

**How to document it:**

Focus on business impact, not just technical implementation. Answer: What problem did this solve? Who did it help? What metrics improved?

**Example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Built user dashboard"

✅ **Clear:** "Built a user analytics dashboard that surfaced usage patterns and feature adoption metrics. Product team now uses it daily to inform roadmap decisions, reducing the time to identify underperforming features from weeks to minutes."

**Another example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Fixed payment processing bug"

✅ **Clear:** "Identified and resolved a race condition in payment processing that was causing 2-3% of transactions to fail. This recovered ~$45K in monthly revenue and eliminated 30+ weekly support tickets."

**Pro tip:** Keep a running log of PRs you ship. Note the business context, not just the technical changes. Tools like [BragDoc's achievement extraction features](/features) can capture this from your Git history automatically. If you want to learn more about why this matters, read our guide on [why developers need automated brag docs](/blog/why-developers-need-automated-brag-docs).

## 2. Mentoring & Knowledge Sharing: Teaching Others

**What it is:** Code reviews, pair programming, onboarding new team members, writing documentation, answering questions, giving tech talks.

**Why it matters:** Senior developers are force multipliers. Your ability to accelerate others is often more valuable than your individual output.

**How to document it:**

Quantify the time and scope. Name the people you helped and what they accomplished as a result.

**Example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Mentored junior developers"

✅ **Clear:** "Mentored two junior engineers through their first production features, spending 4-5 hours per week on code reviews, pair programming, and 1-on-1 technical guidance. Both engineers now contribute independently and have taken on increasingly complex work."

**Another example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Improved documentation"

✅ **Clear:** "Wrote comprehensive onboarding docs for our GraphQL API after noticing new engineers spent 2-3 days ramping up. New team members now get productive in under a day, and the docs are referenced 50+ times per month by the broader engineering team."

**Pro tip:** Track code reviews separately. "Reviewed 120+ PRs this quarter, averaging 1-2 hours daily. Provided detailed feedback that improved code quality and caught 3 security issues before they reached production."

## 3. Architecture & Technical Decisions: Shaping the System

**What it is:** System design, technology choices, technical strategy, refactoring, reducing technical debt, setting technical direction.

**Why it matters:** These decisions compound over time. Good architecture enables faster development. Bad architecture creates years of pain.

**How to document it:**

Explain the problem, the options you considered, why you chose what you did, and the long-term impact.

**Example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Led architecture discussions"

✅ **Clear:** "Proposed and championed migrating our monolithic API to a microservices architecture after identifying scalability bottlenecks. Led technical design discussions, evaluated trade-offs, and built consensus across 4 engineering teams. The migration is now underway and will enable us to scale to 10x current traffic."

**Another example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Refactored legacy code"

✅ **Clear:** "Refactored our authentication system to eliminate a 3-year-old legacy codebase that was blocking feature development. This unblocked 5 engineers who were previously spending 30% of their time working around limitations in the old system. New auth features that previously took weeks now take days."

**Pro tip:** Architecture decisions often happen in RFCs, design docs, or Slack threads. [Save these](/blog/why-developers-need-automated-brag-docs). They're evidence of your technical judgment and leadership.

## 4. Process Improvements: Reducing Friction

**What it is:** Improving CI/CD pipelines, dev tooling, testing infrastructure, deployment processes, reducing build times, automating manual work.

**Why it matters:** Process improvements multiply everyone's productivity. A 10% efficiency gain across a 20-person team is massive.

**How to document it:**

Quantify time saved or problems eliminated. Show the multiplier effect across the team.

**Example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Improved CI/CD pipeline"

✅ **Clear:** "Reduced CI build times from 25 minutes to 8 minutes by parallelizing test suites and optimizing Docker layer caching. This saves every engineer ~1 hour per day in context switching and enables faster iteration. Across a 15-person team, this recovers ~300 engineering hours per month."

**Another example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Automated deployment process"

✅ **Clear:** "Built automated deployment tooling that replaced a 30-minute manual process with a one-click deploy. This eliminated deployment errors that were causing 1-2 production incidents per month and freed up ~10 hours of engineering time per week."

**Pro tip:** Before/after metrics are gold here. Measure time saved, error rates reduced, or manual steps eliminated. [BragDoc](/features) helps you track these automatically.

## 5. Incident Response & Reliability: Keeping Things Running

**What it is:** Debugging production issues, on-call rotations, monitoring and alerting, postmortems, proactive reliability improvements.

**Why it matters:** Keeping systems running is often invisible until something breaks. Reliability work prevents future fires.

**How to document it:**

Focus on severity, speed of resolution, and preventative measures you implemented.

**Example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Fixed production issues"

✅ **Clear:** "Diagnosed and resolved a critical database deadlock that was causing 15-minute outages every few days. Root cause was complex (race condition under high load), but I identified it within 2 hours using query logs and APM traces. Implemented connection pooling changes that eliminated the issue entirely. No recurrence in 3 months."

**Another example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Participated in on-call rotation"

✅ **Clear:** "Covered on-call rotation for 6 weeks, responding to 12 incidents with an average resolution time of 45 minutes (team average is 90 minutes). After noticing repeated alerts for the same issue, I proactively fixed the underlying problem, reducing alerts by 40% for the entire team."

**Pro tip:** [Keep a log](/blog/why-developers-need-automated-brag-docs) of significant incidents you resolved. Note the business impact (users affected, downtime, revenue impact) and how you prevented future occurrences.

## 6. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Working Beyond Engineering

**What it is:** Working with product, design, sales, customer success, or leadership to solve problems, unblock projects, or improve processes.

**Why it matters:** Senior developers bridge technical and business contexts. Your ability to collaborate across functions becomes increasingly important as you grow.

**How to document it:**

Explain the business problem, how you contributed, and the outcome. Make your role clear without taking sole credit.

**Example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Worked with product team"

✅ **Clear:** "Partnered with product and design to redesign our notification system after customer feedback showed users were missing critical updates. Led technical feasibility discussions, prototyped 3 different approaches, and implemented the solution. User engagement with notifications increased 45%, and support tickets about missed notifications dropped 60%."

**Another example:**

❌ **Vague:** "Helped sales team with technical questions"

✅ **Clear:** "Supported 8 enterprise sales deals by joining technical discovery calls, answering security and compliance questions, and scoping custom integrations. My involvement helped close 3 deals worth $180K in ARR. Sales team now includes me proactively in complex technical evaluations."

**Pro tip:** When collaborating, acknowledge teammates but make your specific contribution clear. "Partnered with X to do Y, where I specifically handled Z."

## Why This Matters for Your Career

Senior developers aren't just senior because they write more code. They're senior because they create leverage—they multiply the productivity of everyone around them through mentoring, architecture, process improvements, and cross-functional collaboration.

If your performance review only documents features you shipped, you're underselling 80% of your actual value.
