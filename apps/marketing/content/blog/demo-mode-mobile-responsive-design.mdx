# Experience BragDoc Instantly

We've made it easier than ever to explore BragDoc without any friction. Whether you want to dive in immediately or test the full platform on your phone, we've got you covered. Today we're highlighting two features that make BragDoc more accessible: our new Demo Mode and significantly enhanced mobile-responsive design.

## Try Demo Mode - No Signup Required

One of the most common barriers to trying new tools is the signup process. Not with BragDoc. We've built a Demo Mode that lets you experience the full power of the platform in seconds, with zero friction.

Here's how it works: visit the [demo page](/demo), click the button, and you're instantly exploring BragDoc with pre-populated sample data. No email address. No password to remember. No credit card. Just instant access to the full platform.

### What You Get in Demo Mode

The demo account comes pre-loaded with realistic sample data across multiple projects and companies. You'll see:

- Real achievements across different projects (repos, documentation, examples)
- Impact ratings and standup documents
- Complete project and company information
- Everything configured exactly as it would be in a real account

The best part? All the data is time-shifted to be current. Even though the demo data was created weeks ago, it appears fresh and recent. This gives you a genuine sense of what your own achievements would look like in BragDoc.

### Try Every Feature

Demo Mode gives you access to the [entire platform](/features) - both [paid and free features](/pricing). You can:

- Review your dashboard with stats and activity
- Browse projects and companies
- View detailed achievement records
- Explore reports and analytics
- Test all the UI features on any device

All of this is completely risk-free. Your demo account is temporary and automatically deleted when you log out. No lingering data. No privacy concerns. Just pure exploration.

When you're ready to move to a real account, the process is simple - just create a free account directly from the demo. Your real data stays yours, [completely private and secure](/how-it-works). We also offer [privacy controls](/privacy) and the option to [self-host](/self-hosting) for maximum data protection.

## Mobile Responsive Design Improvements

We've been investing in making BragDoc work splendidly on mobile devices. Achievement tracking shouldn't be confined to your desk - you should be able to review your work and prepare standups from anywhere.

Over the past few days, we've rolled out significant responsive design improvements across multiple pages of the application. Learn more about [what we've built in V2](/blog/bragdoc-v2-beta-launch), and we'll continue to focus on making the app work as well as possible on all devices.
