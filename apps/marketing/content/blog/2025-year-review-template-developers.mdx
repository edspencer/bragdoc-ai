The year is almost over, and your memories of 2025 are still fresh. By February, they won't be.

This is your window. Right now, before the holidays, before the new year fog sets in, you can document what you actually accomplished while everything is fresh. Do it now and you'll walk into Q1 performance reviews prepared. Wait until review season and you'll scramble like you always do.

![The same work can lead to different outcomes depending on how it's documented](/images/blog/2025-year-review-template-developers/promotable-vs-not.png)

Below is a practical template you can use immediately. It's organized by the [six types of developer impact](/blog/six-types-developer-impact), includes prompts to jog your memory, and provides space to capture the concrete details that matter for performance reviews.

## How to Use This Template

**[Use the interactive worksheet](/templates/year-review-2025)** - fill it out directly in your browser, auto-saves as you type, and download as PDF when done. Or copy the template below into your notes app.

**Time required:** 60-90 minutes over the next few days

**What to do:**
1. Open the [interactive worksheet](/templates/year-review-2025) or copy this template into a document
2. Work through each section, using the prompts to help you remember what you did
3. Link to PRs, issues, and commits where possible
4. Focus on specificity and measurable impact, not flowery language

**When you're done:** You have your foundation for a strong performance review. [Managers](/blog/what-managers-look-for-performance-reviews) use documentation like this to advocate for promotions and raises.

## Common Patterns to Capture

As you fill this out, watch for these patterns—they make strong performance review ammunition:

**Leverage:** Did you do work that multiplied other people's productivity? (Infrastructure improvements, mentoring, tooling)

**Prevention:** Did you stop problems from happening? (Monitoring, proactive fixes, refactoring debt)

**Growth:** Did you take on something new? Level up your skills? Handle more responsibility?

**Business impact:** Can you connect your technical work to business outcomes? (Revenue, retention, user satisfaction, cost)

**Leadership:** Did you influence decisions beyond your own code? Lead discussions? Gain consensus?

**Ownership:** Did you see something through completely? Or were you part of a larger initiative?

## After You Fill This Out

Here's what a strong entry looks like when it's done:

![Example of a filled-out Major Projects entry](/images/blog/2025-year-review-template-developers/example-filled.svg)

**Next step 1:** Pick your 3-5 most significant accomplishments. Write one clear sentence for each that captures: what you did + why it mattered + measurable result.

**Next step 2:** Organize these by impact category (the six types above). This shows your manager the full scope of your contributions, not just code you shipped.

**Next step 3:** For each accomplishment, gather supporting evidence: PR links, commit messages, Slack threads, or metrics. You'll want these during your actual review conversation.

**Next step 4:** Practice talking about your work naturally. You should be able to describe each accomplishment in 1-2 minutes without reading from a script.

## Make This Easier Next Year

If filling this out feels like a lot of work, you're right—it is. The concept of a [brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) has helped thousands of developers track their work, but the key is documenting throughout the year rather than scrambling at year-end.

For the code and features part, [automated extraction tools](/blog/why-developers-need-automated-brag-docs) can capture this automatically from your Git history. You still need to add context and metrics, but you're not starting from memory.

For everything else—mentoring, reliability, process improvements, collaboration—keep a simple monthly note. Just a few bullet points every month about what you're proud of. By December, you have the raw material ready.

Start next year with this habit. By December 2026, you'll have a year's worth of documentation ready to go.

## You're Ready

Print this template. Spend the next few days filling it out. By the time you take the holidays off, you'll have clear, concrete documentation of what you accomplished in 2025.

When Q1 reviews arrive, you won't scramble. You won't undersell your work. You'll walk in prepared.

Your career will thank you for it.
