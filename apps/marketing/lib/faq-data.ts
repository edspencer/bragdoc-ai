        question: 'How do I install BragDoc?',
        answer:
          'Simply run `npm install -g @bragdoc/cli` then `bragdoc login`. The entire setup takes about 2 minutes.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need the CLI or can I use just the web app?',
        answer:
          'While both work, the CLI is enormously more convenient as it will continually extract your achievements automatically from your Git commits. The web app is great for reviewing and organizing, but the CLI handles the heavy lifting of tracking your work without any manual effort.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Which LLM should I use?',
        answer:
          "Ollama is free and runs locally on your machine. OpenAI and Anthropic are cloud-based options with excellent quality. It's your choice - all work great!",
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does setup take?',
        answer:
          'About 5 minutes total: install the CLI, login, initialize your project, and configure your LLM provider.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I try it before committing?',
        answer:
          'Yes! Everything is free to start. Optional paid features (cloud AI document generation) are only $4.99/month and you can try them risk-free.',
      },

    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Does BragDoc see my code?',
        answer:
          'No. The CLI only reads git commit metadata (messages, dates, authors). Your actual code never leaves your machine.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Where is my data stored?',
        answer:
          'Your achievements are stored in our US-based cloud infrastructure (or you can self-host). Your code always stays on your machine.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I self-host?',
        answer:
          'Yes! BragDoc is fully open source. You can deploy it to your own infrastructure and have complete control.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What data is sent to LLM providers?',
        answer:
          'This is configurable! You can choose to send just commit messages, commit messages plus diff stats, or even the entire diff if you want maximum context. Note that sending full diffs will use significantly more tokens, making it either slower or more expensive depending on your LLM provider. You can also apply various limits to the total number of tokens sent in the diff to control costs and performance.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I run 100% offline?',
        answer:
          'Self-host BragDoc and use local Ollama for AI processing. This gives you zero cloud dependencies.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is it safe for proprietary code?',
        answer:
          'Yes. Your code never leaves your machine. Only achievements (which you review and approve) are sent to the cloud.',

    questions: [
      {
        question: 'How does achievement extraction work?',
        answer:
          'The CLI runs `git log`, sends commit messages to your configured LLM, the AI extracts achievements, and saves them to the web app for your review.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What git repositories are supported?',
        answer:
          "Any git repository. Public, private, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, on-premise - if it's git, it works.",
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I use this with private repos?',
        answer:
          'Yes! The CLI runs locally on your machine and works with any repository you can access.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How accurate is the AI extraction?',
        answer:
          "Very accurate. You review and edit all extractions before they're saved. The AI learns your style over time.",
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I edit extracted achievements?',
        answer:
          'Yes! Full CRUD operations in the web app. Edit title, description, impact rating, dates, and project tags.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Does it work with monorepos?',
        answer:
          'Yes! The CLI analyzes the full git history regardless of your repository structure.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How many projects can I track?',
        answer: 'Unlimited on all plans. Track as many projects as you need.',

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What's actually free?",
        answer:
          'Everything except cloud AI features. If you use your own LLM (like Ollama locally), BragDoc is completely free.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What do I pay for?',
        answer:
          'Optional cloud AI document generation is $4.99/month. If you use your own LLM, you pay nothing.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How much does LLM usage cost?',
        answer:
          '$0.01-0.05 per 100 commits with GPT-4. $0 with Ollama running locally.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I switch between free and paid?',

      {
        question: 'Is there enterprise pricing?',
        answer:
          'No. This is an individual tool aimed at individual software engineers, not enterprises.',

      {
        question: 'How does caching work?',
        answer:
          'The CLI stores processed commit hashes locally. It never reprocesses the same commits.',

        question: 'How do I change my schedule?',
