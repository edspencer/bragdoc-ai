      "details": "Completed enhancement to the RecentAchievementsTable component to properly handle achievements belonging to the current standup period. This addresses the temporal boundary between historical and current achievements. The component now calculates the current standup period's start date using getStandupAchievementDateRange() based on the standup's schedule configuration (timezone, meeting time, days mask). Achievements with eventStart or createdAt dates on or after this timestamp are filtered out from the orphaned achievements list, preventing them from appearing prematurely before the current standup document is generated. Additionally restructured the UI render order to be more logical: standup documents appear first, followed by the 'Generate Missing Standup Documents' button (when needed), and finally the filtered orphaned achievements section. Updated the button visibility logic to check filteredOrphanedAchievements instead of the raw orphaned list, ensuring accurate detection of missing standup documents. This change prepares for the future 'Today's Standup' component (tracked separately) which will display achievements from the current period that haven't been included in a standup document yet.",
