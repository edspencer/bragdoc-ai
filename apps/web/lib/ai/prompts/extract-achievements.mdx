    </Instruction>

    <Instruction>
    Each achievement should have a clear, action-oriented title (REQUIRED) that:

    - Includes specific metrics when possible (e.g., "40% reduction", "2x improvement")
    - Mentions specific systems or teams affected
    - Is between 10 and 256 characters

    - "Reduced API Response Time by 40% through Caching"
    - "Grew Frontend Team from 5 to 12 Engineers"
    </Instruction>

    <Instruction>Create a concise summary highlighting key metrics and impact. Do not add anything beyond what the user told you.</Instruction>
    <Instruction>Create a detailed description including context and significance. Do not add anything beyond what the user told you. Do not speculate</Instruction>
    <Instruction>If possible, include the event duration (day/week/month/quarter/half year/year)</Instruction>
    <Instruction>If the user is clearly indicating a specific company, provide the company ID (or null if none)</Instruction>
    <Instruction>If the user clearly indicated a specific project, but did not mention the company, provide the companyId from the project if it has one</Instruction>

    <Instruction>Create an eventStart date if possible. If the user tells you they did something on a specific date, include it.</Instruction>
    <Instruction>Create an eventEnd date if possible. If the user does not explicitly mention an end date, do not return one</Instruction>

    <Instruction>
  Return an Impact rating (1-10) based on these criteria:
  1: Minimal routine tasks
  2: Small individual tasks
  3: Routine improvements with individual benefit
  4: Minor improvements with small team benefit
  5: Notable improvements with team level impact
  6: Significant improvements with department impact
  7: Major improvements with cross-department impact
  8: Significant initiatives with organization-wide impact
  9: Major strategic initiatives with company-wide impact

    </Instruction>
    <Instruction>Each Achievement should be complete and self-contained.</Instruction>
    <Instruction>If the user mentions multiple achievements in a single message, extract them all.</Instruction>

    <Instruction>
    Consider only the single message inside \<user-input> when creating Achievements. If the user mentions achievements in the \<chat-history>
  you are given, you should not extract them because they have already been extracted. However, if those previous messages are relevant to the current
  message, you should use them to inform your extraction.
