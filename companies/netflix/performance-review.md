# Netflix Performance Review Process

> Last researched: 2025-01-15
> Confidence: High - Well-documented unique approach with public information from leadership

## Overview

Netflix has **completely eliminated traditional annual performance reviews** in favor of continuous 360-degree feedback. Their approach is built on radical transparency and the controversial "Keeper Test."

This system is detailed in Reed Hastings' book *No Rules Rules* and represents one of the most distinctive approaches to performance management in tech.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: Continuous 360 Feedback (no formal name)
- **Frequency**: Continuous - no formal annual cycle
- **Timing**: Ongoing throughout the year
- **Eligibility**: All employees

## The Keeper Test

The ultimate evaluation at Netflix is the **Keeper Test**. Managers constantly ask themselves:

> "Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at a competitor, would I fight hard to keep?"

If the answer is no, the employee is given a **generous severance package**, making room for an "A player."

### Key Characteristics

- Brutally honest framework
- Managers must justify keeping every team member
- Employees aren't evaluated on short-term failures but overall track record
- Encourages bold experimentation (you won't be punished for individual failures)

### Criticisms

- Creates a "culture of fear" according to some Glassdoor reviews
- Makes some managers feel pressured to fire people or "look soft"
- Work-life balance can be difficult in the highly competitive environment

## Feedback Format

### Start, Stop, Continue

Netflix uses a simple three-question framework for all feedback:

1. **"What should this person continue doing?"**
   - Positive reinforcement of effective behaviors

2. **"What should this person start doing?"**
   - New behaviors or practices to adopt

3. **"What should this person stop doing?"**
   - Constructive criticism about behaviors to eliminate
   - This is the primary source of constructive feedback

### Question Order

Questions are intentionally ordered to put positive feedback first, both for the person giving feedback and for the manager synthesizing it.

### Character/Word Limits

None specified - the format prioritizes quality and honesty over length constraints.

## Evolution of 360 Feedback

Netflix's approach has evolved over time:

### Phase 1: Anonymous Written 360s
- Initial implementation used anonymous feedback
- Designed to reduce awkwardness

### Phase 2: Signed Written 360s
- Shifted to attributed feedback
- Full transparency about who said what

### Phase 3: Live 360s (Current)
- Face-to-face 360-degree reviews
- Manager and team gather for several hours
- Each employee takes a turn receiving feedback in front of the group
- Provides insight into team dynamics as a whole

Reed Hastings observed that "the biggest benefit of the written 360s was the discussions that grew out of the written comments," leading to the live format.

## The 4A Feedback Guidelines

To help employees master candid feedback, Netflix provides the "4A" principles:

### For Giving Feedback

1. **Aim to Assist** - Feedback must come from a genuine desire to help
2. **Actionable** - Feedback should be specific and actionable

### For Receiving Feedback

3. **Appreciate** - Thank people for feedback, even when it's hard to hear
4. **Accept or Discard** - You decide what to act on, but genuinely consider all feedback

## No Formal Ratings

Netflix does not use:
- Numerical ratings
- Performance designations
- Stack ranking
- Forced distribution curves

The Keeper Test is the de facto evaluation: you're either someone worth fighting to keep, or you're not.

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Embrace radical candor**: Give and receive honest feedback regularly
- **Build strong relationships**: Your colleagues' willingness to "fight to keep you" matters
- **Demonstrate consistent value**: The Keeper Test looks at track record, not just recent work
- **Take bold risks**: Netflix culture rewards experimentation
- **Contribute to team success**: Live 360s reveal how you work with others

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Avoiding giving honest feedback (seen as not being a team player)
- Taking feedback personally instead of professionally
- Focusing only on individual contributions while neglecting team dynamics
- Letting fear of the Keeper Test prevent risk-taking
- Not actively participating in the feedback culture
