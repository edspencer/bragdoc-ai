# Microsoft Performance Review Process

> Last researched: 2025-01-15
> Confidence: High - Well-documented Connect process with specific structural information

## Overview

Microsoft uses the **Connect** system, a continuous feedback model that replaced the old rigid annual review system. The key is flexibility combined with accountability.

Recent changes in 2024-2025 include tying security efforts to performance reviews - not producing substantial security-focused work can negatively impact salary increases, promotions, and bonuses.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: Connect
- **Frequency**: Ongoing with formal cycles in June and November
- **Timing**:
  - Mid-June: Employees fill self-assessment
  - Late June - Mid August: Manager and leadership discussions
  - Mid August - Mid September: Results shared to employees
- **Eligibility**: Not publicly specified

## Self-Review

### Format

Structured self-review built around the **"Three Circles of Impact"** framework, plus additional sections for growth mindset and strengths.

### Questions

The Connect document has 4-5 distinct sections:

1. **Key Individual Accomplishments**
   > "Key individual accomplishments that contribute to team, business, or customer results."
   - What to include: Your direct contributions and their impact

2. **Contributions to Others**
   > "Your contributions to the success of others (collaboration/mentorship)."
   - What to include: How you helped teammates, cross-team collaboration, mentoring

3. **Built on Others' Work**
   > "Results that were built on the work, ideas, or effort of others."
   - What to include: Acknowledge whose work enabled your success

4. **Growth Mindset** (required)
   > "Share how you applied a growth mindset. Consider when you could have done something differently. How will you apply what you learned in the future?"
   - Important: This is NOT about listing mistakes. Focus on learnings and future impact.

5. **Strengths** (optional)
   > "What is your strength that you would like to apply at work?"
   - Most people leave this blank

### Character/Word Limits

Not publicly documented.

## Evaluation Axes

The Three Circles of Impact represent Microsoft's core evaluation dimensions:

1. **Individual Impact** - Your direct contributions to results
2. **Impact on Others** - How you enable others' success
3. **Leveraging Others** - How you build on others' work

### Growth Mindset

Microsoft heavily emphasizes growth mindset as part of its culture transformation under Satya Nadella. This is explicitly evaluated in the review process.

## Peer Feedback ("Perspectives")

### Format

Microsoft calls peer feedback "Perspectives." The system is employee-driven, not manager-driven.

### Process

1. You request feedback from peers (not assigned by manager)
2. Perspectives are collected right before Connect (May and November)
3. This is technically separate from the Connect process

### Limits

- Selection: Employee selects their own reviewers
- Number: Not publicly specified
- **Anonymity: NOT anonymous** - The identity of feedback givers is known to both the recipient and their manager

## Calibration & Ratings

### Process

Microsoft has moved away from "calibration" or "stack ranking" terminology. These meetings are now called **"talent reviews"** or **"talent celebrations."**

1. Managers create a 1-pager for each report based on Connect document
2. This 1-pager is NOT shown to employees
3. Managers present employees in meetings with other managers
4. Employees are compared to ensure fairness

### Rating Scale

Microsoft has moved away from explicit numbered ratings. The focus is on:
- Impact delivered
- Growth demonstrated
- Potential for future contributions

Specific rating designations are not publicly documented.

## 2024-2025 Updates

### Security Mandate

An internal memo from Microsoft's Chief People Officer outlined that security efforts are now tied to performance reviews:

- Not producing substantial security-focused work can negatively impact:
  - Salary increases
  - Promotions
  - Bonuses

This reflects Microsoft's increased focus on security following various incidents.

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Fill all three circles**: Don't leave any section empty
- **Show growth mindset authentically**: Share real learnings, not just wins
- **Acknowledge others**: The "Built on Others" section shows maturity
- **Request strategic Perspectives**: Choose people who saw your best work
- **Document continuously**: Don't wait for Connect cycles

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using Growth Mindset section to list failures (focus on learnings instead)
- Ignoring the "Contributions to Others" circle
- Not requesting enough Perspectives
- Waiting until the deadline to write your Connect
