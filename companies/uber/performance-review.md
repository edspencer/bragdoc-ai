# Uber Performance Review Process

> Last researched: 2025-01-15
> Confidence: Medium - Good information on T3B3 format, less detail on exact questions

## Overview

Uber uses the **T3 B3 (Top 3, Bottom 3)** process for performance reviews. This system replaced Uber's previous numerical scoring system and focuses on identifying strengths to leverage and areas to improve.

The T3 B3 approach also includes individual goals and a unique "citizen's goal" component.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: T3 B3 (Top 3, Bottom 3)
- **Frequency**: Biannual
- **Timing**: June and December
- **Eligibility**: Not publicly specified

## Self-Review: T3 B3 Format

### Format

The core of Uber's self-review is the T3 B3 framework - a structured approach to self-assessment.

### Questions

1. **Top 3 (T3)**
   > List your top three qualities or strengths
   - What you do best
   - Your key differentiators
   - Strengths that drive results

2. **Bottom 3 (B3)**
   > List your bottom three areas that need improvement
   - Where you have room to grow
   - Skills to develop
   - Behaviors to change

3. **Individual Goals**
   - Specific objectives for the review period
   - Measurable outcomes you're working toward

4. **Citizen's Goal**
   - A unique Uber addition
   - Good deeds done for others inside or outside the company
   - Reflects Uber's emphasis on community contribution

### Character/Word Limits

Not publicly documented.

## Peer Feedback

### Format

Peers provide feedback on your performance during the review cycle.

### Process

1. You select 3-5 peers to provide feedback
2. Peers comment on what you're doing well
3. Peers identify areas for growth

### Questions

Peers are asked about:
- Top things you're doing well
- Areas where you have room for growth

### Limits

- Number of reviewers: 3-5 (self-selected)
- Word limits: Not publicly documented

## Manager Assessment

Managers provide feedback based on:
- Your T3 B3 self-assessment
- Peer feedback received
- Direct observations

## Senior Level Reviews (L5b+)

For senior engineers (L5b and above), the review process is more intensive:

### Committee Interview

- Hour-long interview with the calibration committee
- Not like interviewing as a new hire, but more than a formality
- May include behavioral questions like "What would you do in this scenario?"
- Your performance is discussed and evaluated by multiple leaders

## Calibration & Ratings

### Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Below | Does not meet expectations for level |
| Meets | Meets expectations for level |
| Exceeds | Exceeds expectations for level |

Expectations are calibrated based on your level - what "meets" means for an L4 is different from an L6.

### Process

- Managers present their reports' performance
- Calibration ensures fairness across teams
- Senior employees face committee review

## Historical Context

### Previous System

Uber's old system numerically scored employees on both good and bad performance. The T3 B3 process was introduced to:
- Shift focus from numbers to development
- Emphasize strengths alongside improvements
- Add the "citizen's goal" community component

### Cultural Shift

The T3 B3 system reflects Uber's cultural evolution, moving from a purely performance-driven culture to one that also values community contribution and personal development.

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Be honest in B3**: Acknowledging real weaknesses shows self-awareness
- **Make T3 specific**: Generic strengths are less compelling
- **Document citizen goals**: Track your community contributions throughout the cycle
- **Choose strategic peer reviewers**: Select people who've seen your best work
- **Prepare for committee review (L5b+)**: Senior folks should be ready to articulate their impact

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Listing vague or generic strengths in T3
- Being defensive in B3 (real weaknesses, not humble-brags)
- Ignoring the citizen's goal component
- Not preparing for the senior-level committee interview
- Waiting until review time to document accomplishments
