## Overview

Google uses the **GRAD (Googler Reviews and Development)** system, introduced in May 2022 to replace their previous more complex biannual review process. The change was driven by internal feedback indicating that 47% of employees found the previous system inefficient and time-consuming.

A key shift in GRAD is that managers are now responsible for writing the performance review, rather than employees writing detailed self-assessments.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: GRAD (Googler Reviews and Development)
- **Frequency**: Annual (changed from biannual in 2022)
- **Timing**: End of year
- **Eligibility**: Not specified publicly

## Self-Review

### Format

The self-review in GRAD is significantly simplified compared to the previous system. Employees receive a **single open-ended question** where they document their work for the review period.

### Questions

1. **Main Self-Review Question**
   > List your specific projects, your role in each, and what you accomplished.
   - Character/word limit: Not publicly documented
   - What to include: Projects, your specific role, accomplishments with measurable impact

The self-review is used as a reference document for peers writing their feedback, ensuring reviewers understand the full scope of your work.

### What to Cover

Your self-review should address these four dimensions:

1. **Googleyness** - Demonstrated adherence to Google's values
2. **Execution** - The ability to deliver high-quality work in a timely manner
3. **Thought Leadership** - Leadership for project delivery, team health, architecture, or other initiatives with measurable impact
4. **Problem-solving Skill** - Using past experience and analytical ability to solve problems

## Evaluation Axes

Software engineers at Google are evaluated on **scope and impact**, broken down as:

1. **Business Results** - The impact you drove, measured per level:
   - L3: Individual-level impact
   - L4: Project-level impact
   - L5: Team-level impact
   - L6: Org-level impact

2. **Technical Problem Solving** - Solving ambiguous problems, anticipating future issues, demonstrating design judgment

3. **Thought Leadership** - Being recognized as an authority, having others defer to your expertise

4. **Presence** - Making yourself heard in a noisy organization

## Peer Feedback

### Format

Simplified peer feedback focused on actionable improvements.

### Questions

1. **"What is one thing this person should do more of?"**

2. **"What is one thing they could do differently to have more impact?"**

According to former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock, this simplified format was intentional: "If people had just one thing to focus on, they'd be more likely to achieve genuine change."

### Limits

- Number of reviewers: Not specified publicly
- Word/character limit: Not specified publicly
- Anonymity: Anonymous to the employee, but managers can see which of their reports rated others positively or negatively

## Manager Assessment

In GRAD, the manager is responsible for writing the performance review based on:
- Employee's self-review
- Peer feedback
- Their own observations

This is a shift from the previous system where employees wrote more detailed self-assessments.

## Calibration & Ratings

### Process

Managers present ratings at calibration meetings. Ratings are compared across teams to ensure fairness and consistency.

### Rating Scale

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Not Enough Impact | Below expectations |
| Moderate Impact | Meets some expectations |
| Significant Impact | Meets expectations (most common) |
| Outstanding Impact | Exceeds expectations |
| Transformative Impact | Exceptional performance |

Most employees receive "Significant Impact." The 2024-2025 updates allow managers to give "Outstanding Impact" to more people, enabling increased bonuses and equity awards for top performers.

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Document throughout the year**: Keep a running log of projects and achievements
- **Make documentation visible**: Ensure your name is on scoping documents, launch reviews, design docs
- **Focus on measurable impact**: Quantify outcomes whenever possible
- **Build thought leadership**: Become the recognized expert on something
- **Demonstrate presence**: Make your work visible across the organization

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Waiting until review time to document achievements
- Focusing on activities rather than outcomes
- Not making your work visible to others
- Leaving your manager unaware of key accomplishments
