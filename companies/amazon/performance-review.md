> Last researched: 2025-01-15
> Confidence: High - Well-documented two-track system with detailed information available

## Overview

Amazon uses a two-track performance evaluation system:

1. **Forte** - The employee-facing feedback cycle where you write self-reviews and receive peer feedback
2. **OLR (Organizational Leadership Review)** - The closed-door calibration process where real ratings and decisions are made

Everything at Amazon is anchored to the **16 Leadership Principles (LPs)**, which form the foundation of performance evaluation.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: Forte (employee-facing) + OLR (calibration)
- **Frequency**: Biannual
- **Timing**: Q1 (typically December-February) and Q3
- **Eligibility**: 3 months minimum employment

## Self-Review

### Format

Free-form self-feedback explicitly anchored to Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles. You describe your work and connect it to specific LPs you demonstrated.

### Questions

The self-review is a single free-form text field where you:
1. Describe your accomplishments and impact
2. Reference which Leadership Principles you championed
3. Provide specific examples for each LP mentioned

### Character/Word Limits

- Self-review: Not publicly documented
- The format is free-form with no rigid structure

### What to Include

- Specific projects and your role
- Measurable outcomes and impact
- Which Leadership Principles you demonstrated
- Examples showing LP alignment

## Evaluation Axes

Engineers are evaluated on two primary dimensions:

1. **Performance** (backward-looking)
   - What did you achieve in the past few months?
   - Concrete deliverables and impact

2. **Potential** (forward-looking)
   - How will you perform in the future?
   - Growth rate and trajectory
   - Ambition and scalability

### Leadership Principles

All evaluation ties back to Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles:
- Customer Obsession
- Ownership
- Invent and Simplify
- Are Right, A Lot
- Learn and Be Curious
- Hire and Develop the Best
- Insist on the Highest Standards
- Think Big
- Bias for Action
- Frugality
- Earn Trust
- Dive Deep
- Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
- Deliver Results
- Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
- Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

## Peer Feedback

### Format

Structured peer feedback with specific sections and character limits.

### Sections

1. **Superpowers** - What this person does exceptionally well
   - 60 words maximum
   - Select up to 3 Leadership Principles that describe their strengths

2. **Areas for Improvement** - Where they can grow
   - 60 words maximum
   - Select up to 3 Leadership Principles for development areas

### Limits

- Word limit: 60 words per section
- LP selections: Up to 3 per section (checkbox format)
- Number of reviewers: Not publicly specified

## OLR (Organizational Leadership Review)

### Process

1. Senior leaders meet to discuss and calibrate ratings across teams
2. Managers advocate for their team members
3. Ratings are often adjusted to meet distribution quotas
4. Process is a negotiation - your fate depends partly on your manager's advocacy skills

### Meeting Format

1. Attendees read the meeting agenda
2. Supervisors suggest subordinates for promotion consideration
3. All executives evaluate and debate alternatives
4. Promotions decided at the end

### Rating Dimensions

| Dimension | Scale | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Performance | 1-7 | Backward-looking achievement |
| Potential | 1-4 | Forward-looking growth trajectory |

### Overall Value Ratings

The Performance × Potential combination maps to an Overall Value rating:

| Rating | Target Distribution |
|--------|-------------------|
| Least Effective (LE) | ~5% |
| Highly Valued 1 (HV1) | ~35% |
| Highly Valued 2 (HV2) | ~25% |
| Highly Valued 3 (HV3) | ~15% |
| Top Tier (TT) | ~20% |

"Exceeds expectations" corresponds to Top Tier (TT) and HV3 ratings.

## Low Performance Process

Amazon has a structured process for underperformers:

1. **Focus** (Development Plan)
   - 10-15% of each org is put into Focus each cycle
   - Given a well-defined project to demonstrate improvement

2. **Pivot**
   - If Focus is unsuccessful
   - Choice: Exit with severance OR move to PIP

3. **PIP** (Performance Improvement Plan)
   - Aggressive project with tight deadlines
   - Most Amazonians on PIP do not survive
   - Failure results in termination

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Anchor everything to LPs**: Explicitly name which Leadership Principles you demonstrated
- **Document with specifics**: Amazon culture values data and specifics
- **Choose LPs strategically**: Focus on 3-5 LPs you can demonstrate strongly
- **Build manager relationship**: Your manager advocates for you in OLR
- **Deliver measurable results**: "Deliver Results" is a key LP

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Writing generically without LP references
- Choosing too many LPs (focus on 3-5 strong ones)
- Not providing specific, measurable examples
- Underestimating the importance of manager advocacy
- Ignoring the "potential" dimension
