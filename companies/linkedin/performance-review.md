# LinkedIn Performance Review Process

> Last researched: 2025-01-15
> Confidence: Low - Limited public information available

## Overview

LinkedIn uses **Salesforce's work.com** (formerly Rypple) platform for performance reviews. Reviews are conducted quarterly and evaluate employees across three core areas.

Note: As a Microsoft subsidiary (acquired in 2016), LinkedIn may share some practices with Microsoft, but maintains its own distinct review process.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: work.com (Salesforce platform)
- **Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Timing**: Every quarter
- **Eligibility**: Not publicly specified

## Evaluation Areas

LinkedIn reviews look at performance across three dimensions:

1. **Leadership**
   - How you lead and influence others
   - Decision-making and direction-setting
   - Inspiring and motivating teams

2. **Leverage**
   - How you multiply your impact
   - Enabling others' success
   - Scaling your contributions

3. **Results**
   - What you delivered
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Business impact

## Self-Review

### Format

Limited public information available on the exact format.

### Questions

Specific question wording is not publicly documented.

### Character/Word Limits

Not publicly documented.

## Peer Feedback

### Format

Limited public information available.

### Process

Likely follows standard 360-degree feedback practices given the work.com platform.

## Quarterly Cadence Benefits

LinkedIn's quarterly review cycle offers several advantages:

- **More frequent feedback**: Issues addressed sooner
- **Shorter memory span**: Less recency bias
- **Continuous alignment**: Goals stay current
- **Faster course correction**: Underperformance caught early

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Balance all three areas**: Don't neglect Leadership or Leverage for Results
- **Document quarterly**: With 4 cycles per year, tracking is essential
- **Show leverage**: Demonstrate how you multiply your impact through others
- **Connect to business outcomes**: Link your work to measurable results

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Focusing only on Results while ignoring Leadership and Leverage
- Not adapting to the quarterly cadence (treating it like an annual review)
- Waiting until end of quarter to document accomplishments

## Gaps in Research

- Exact self-review questions
- Character/word limits
- Peer feedback format
- Calibration process
- Rating scale
- How the Microsoft acquisition has affected processes
- Specific work.com configuration for LinkedIn

## Research Notes

LinkedIn's performance review process is less publicly documented than other major tech companies. This may be because:

1. As a Microsoft subsidiary, some information may be internal
2. LinkedIn hasn't had as many career coaching resources written about it
3. The company may not have as distinctive a system (using off-the-shelf work.com)

Further research with current/former LinkedIn employees would be needed to fill in the gaps.
