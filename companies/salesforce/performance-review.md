# Salesforce Performance Review Process

> Confidence: High - V2MOM framework is well-documented and publicly shared by the company

## Overview

Salesforce uses the **V2MOM** framework, created by CEO Marc Benioff in 1999 when he co-founded the company. V2MOM stands for Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures.

The framework is designed to create alignment throughout the organization by answering five fundamental questions at every level - from the company down to individual contributors.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Measures)
- **Frequency**: Living document, reviewed continuously
- **Timing**: Created annually, updated throughout the year
- **Eligibility**: All employees (everyone writes their own V2MOM)

## The V2MOM Framework

### Format

Unlike traditional performance reviews with self-assessment questions, V2MOM is a goal-setting and alignment framework. Every employee, team, department, and the company itself creates a V2MOM.

### The Five Questions

Each V2MOM answers these five questions:

1. **Vision**
   > "What does success look like?"
   - Your destination in one bold, clear sentence
   - Should be inspiring and specific

2. **Values**
   > "What matters most as you work toward your vision?"
   - The principles that guide your decisions
   - What you won't compromise on

3. **Methods**
   > "What actions and steps will achieve the vision?"
   - The concrete things you'll do
   - Your roadmap to success

4. **Obstacles**
   > "What challenges might impede progress?"
   - Problems you might encounter
   - Risks to acknowledge and plan for

5. **Measures**
   > "How will you measure performance?"
   - Specific metrics and KPIs
   - How you'll know you've succeeded

### Character/Word Limits

Keep your V2MOM **short and sweet**. Adding too much information creates confusion. The document should be easy to understand for everyone in the organization.

## How V2MOM Works at Different Levels

### Company Level
- Marc Benioff writes the company V2MOM
- Sets direction for the entire organization
- Published to all employees

### Department/Team Level
- Aligns with company V2MOM
- Translates company vision to team context
- Shared within the department

### Individual Level
- Every employee drafts their own V2MOM
- Aligns with team and company V2MOMs
- Basis for performance conversations

## Living Document Philosophy

V2MOM is explicitly designed as a **living, breathing document**:

> "Stagnant management tools like once-a-year performance reviews don't cut it in today's fast-moving environment, which requires that companies adapt continuously."

### Regular Review

- Ongoing conversations with managers about priorities
- Regular updates as circumstances change
- Shared openly to build trust and encourage feedback

## Visibility and Transparency

V2MOMs are visible to everyone they affect:

- Sharing openly builds trust
- Encourages feedback from colleagues
- Turns planning into a "team sport, not a solo act"

## Performance Conversations

Rather than formal annual reviews, Salesforce emphasizes:

- Ongoing 1:1 conversations about V2MOM priorities
- Regular check-ins on progress toward Vision
- Collaborative problem-solving on Obstacles
- Continuous measurement against defined Measures

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Write a compelling Vision**: One sentence that inspires and directs
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Don't list too many Methods or Values
- **Be honest about Obstacles**: Acknowledging challenges shows maturity
- **Define measurable Measures**: Vague metrics lead to vague outcomes
- **Update regularly**: Treat it as a living document, not a one-time exercise

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Writing a Vision that's too vague or too complex
- Listing too many priorities (if everything is important, nothing is)
- Ignoring the Obstacles section
- Setting measures that can't actually be tracked
- Creating a V2MOM and then forgetting about it

## V2MOM Template

```
## Vision
[One clear, inspiring sentence]

## Values
1. [Most important value]
2. [Second value]
3. [Third value]

## Methods
1. [Key action to take]
2. [Another action]
3. [Another action]

## Obstacles
1. [Challenge to address]
2. [Risk to mitigate]

## Measures
1. [Specific metric with target]
2. [Another metric]
```

## Comparison to Traditional Reviews

| Aspect | V2MOM | Traditional Review |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Focus | Future goals | Past performance |
| Timing | Continuous | Annual/biannual |
| Format | 5 strategic questions | Multiple assessment questions |
| Length | Short (1 page ideal) | Often lengthy |
| Visibility | Shared openly | Usually private |
| Updates | Living document | Static snapshot |
