# Apple Performance Review Process

> Last researched: 2025-01-15
> Confidence: High - Specific character limits and structure well-documented

## Overview

Apple uses the **MyPage** tool for performance reviews. The process is annual and evaluates engineers across three performance axes: Teamwork, Project Impact, and Innovation.

Notable: Apple weaves **Diversity and Inclusion** into each of the three axes, rewarding behaviors that ensure underrepresented voices are heard.

## Review Cycle

- **System Name**: MyPage
- **Frequency**: Annual
- **Timing**: Annual Review process (specific months not publicly documented)
- **Eligibility**: Not publicly specified

## Self-Review

### Format

Free-form self-review covering your project impact and engineering behaviors, organized around Apple's three performance axes.

### Questions

The self-review is a single free-form field where you address:
1. Your project impact
2. Good engineering behaviors demonstrated
3. All three performance axes
4. Future career development goals

### Character Limits

**2,500 characters maximum** - This is a hard limit in the MyPage tool.

This tight limit forces concise, impactful writing. The system has been criticized for bad UI/UX and arbitrary limits.

### What to Include

Given the character limit, prioritize:
- Project impact and outcomes
- Key engineering contributions
- Specific examples for each axis
- (Briefly) Career development goals - though the character limit makes this difficult to expand on

## Evaluation Axes

Software engineers are evaluated on three axes:

1. **Teamwork**
   - How collaborative you have been
   - Ability to improve processes, projects, and meetings
   - Bringing diverse voices together
   - Particularly important at senior levels

2. **Project Impact**
   - Your project outcomes
   - Ability to improve user experience
   - High-quality execution
   - On-time delivery

3. **Innovation**
   - Ability to come up with new solutions
   - Creatively identifying opportunities within your team and organization
   - Novel approaches to problems

### Diversity & Inclusion

Apple explicitly weaves D&I into the three axes. For example:
- **Teamwork**: Ensuring underrepresented voices in tech are heard in meetings
- Higher ratings for those who actively foster inclusive environments

## Peer Feedback

### Format

Written feedback in free-form style. Writing style varies by manager and team.

### Process

1. Manager automatically requests feedback from your immediate teammates
2. You can request feedback from up to 5 additional peers outside your team
3. Think strategically about which external peers to request

### Limits

- Number from immediate team: Automatic (all teammates)
- Additional requests: Up to 5 peers outside your team
- **Character limit: None** (unlike the 2,500-char self-review)
- Anonymity: "Loosely anonymized" - you can often reverse-engineer who wrote each feedback based on writing style and content

### What Peers Should Address

Feedback should cover your performance across all three axes, with specific examples.

## Promotion Process

### How It Works

The promotion process at Apple isn't ultra-formal - it occurs alongside the Annual Review process.

- **No nomination required**: You can get promoted without explicit coordination with your manager if the calibration committee thinks you're performing well
- **Manager advocacy matters**: Your manager makes the case for your promotion
- **Documentation is key**: Keep a well-documented list of impact (like a brag journal) so your manager can easily advocate for you

### Level Difficulty

- Standard promotions: Occur naturally with strong performance
- **ICT5 (Staff) promotion**: Extremely difficult - requires exceptional, sustained impact

## Tips for Success

### What High Performers Do

- **Write concisely**: 2,500 characters forces prioritization
- **Keep a brag document**: Essential for both self-review and manager advocacy
- **Build relationships outside your team**: Strategic peer feedback from external colleagues strengthens your review
- **Stay in sync with your manager**: They need to know your accomplishments to advocate for you
- **Cover all three axes**: Even if one is weaker, address it

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Writing too much and hitting the character limit mid-thought
- Not requesting external peer feedback (only relying on automatic team feedback)
- Focusing only on Project Impact while ignoring Teamwork and Innovation
- Not keeping your manager informed of accomplishments
- Waiting until review time to document achievements
