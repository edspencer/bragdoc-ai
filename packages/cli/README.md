## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @bragdoc/cli
```

## Quick Start

1. Authenticate with bragdoc:

```bash
bragdoc login
```

2. Initialize your project:

```bash
bragdoc init
```

3. Extract achievements from commits:

```bash
bragdoc extract
```

## Commands

### Authentication (`auth`)

Manage your bragdoc authentication.

```bash
# Login to bragdoc
bragdoc auth login # aliased as `login`

# Check authentication status
bragdoc auth status

# Logout from bragdoc
bragdoc auth logout # aliased as `logout`
```

### Project Management

Initialize and manage projects that bragdoc will track.

```bash
# Initialize a project (syncs with web app if authenticated)
cd /path/to/repo
bragdoc init
# You'll be prompted to:
# 1. Choose extraction schedule (no/hourly/daily/custom)
# 2. Automatic system installation (crontab/Task Scheduler)

# Or use the projects command (init is an alias for projects add)
bragdoc projects add [path]

# List configured projects (shows schedules)
bragdoc projects list

# Update project settings
bragdoc projects update [path] --name "New Name" --max-commits 200

# Update project schedule (automatically updates system scheduling)
bragdoc projects update [path] --schedule

# Remove a project
bragdoc projects remove [path]

# Enable/disable project tracking
bragdoc projects enable [path]
bragdoc projects disable [path]
```

### Achievement Extraction (`extract`)

Extract achievements from Git commits.

```bash
# Extract from current project
bragdoc extract

# Extract from specific branch
bragdoc extract --branch main

# Limit number of commits
bragdoc extract --max-commits 50

# Dry run to preview what would be extracted
bragdoc extract --dry-run
```

### WIP Extraction (`wip`)

Extract uncommitted work-in-progress from your current project. This command analyzes git status and diffs to generate a summary of changes, but does not upload to the API.

```bash
# Extract WIP from current directory
bragdoc wip

# Extract with verbose logging
bragdoc wip --log
```

**Note**: This command is useful for testing WIP extraction locally. For automated standup WIP extraction, use `bragdoc standup wip`.

### Standup WIP Automation (`standup`)

Automatically extract achievements and work-in-progress summaries before your daily standup meetings. The CLI can extract from multiple projects and submit to your standup in one command.

#### Setup

First, create a standup in the web app at https://app.bragdoc.ai/standups (takes <30 seconds). Then enroll your projects:

```bash
# From within a project directory - enroll single project
cd /path/to/project
bragdoc standup enable

# From anywhere - enroll multiple projects
bragdoc standup enable
# You'll see a checkbox list to select multiple projects
```

When you enable a standup, the CLI will:
1. Fetch your standups from the web app
2. Let you select which standup to configure
3. Automatically set up system scheduling (cron/Task Scheduler)
4. Extract achievements and WIP 10 minutes before your standup time

#### Commands

```bash
# Enable standup WIP extraction
bragdoc standup enable

# Check standup configuration
bragdoc standup status

# Manually extract and submit WIP for all enrolled projects
bragdoc standup wip

# Manually extract for specific standup (if you have multiple)
bragdoc standup wip --id <standupId>

# Disable standup for current project
cd /path/to/project
bragdoc standup disable
```

#### How It Works

**Automatic Mode** (Scheduled):
- 10 minutes before your standup time, the CLI automatically:
  1. Extracts new achievements from git commits (all enrolled projects)
  2. Extracts work-in-progress summaries from uncommitted changes (all enrolled projects)
  3. Submits combined WIP to your standup in the web app

**Manual Mode**:
- Run `bragdoc standup wip` anytime to extract and submit immediately
- Useful for testing or ad-hoc updates

**Multi-Project Support**:
- Enroll multiple projects in a single standup
- WIP extraction runs concurrently across all projects
- Combined summary includes all projects with clear headers

#### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up your first project
cd ~/work/frontend-app
bragdoc init --name "Frontend App"
bragdoc standup enable
# Select your standup from the list

# 2. Add more projects to the same standup
cd ~/work/backend-api
bragdoc init --name "Backend API"
bragdoc standup enable
# Select the same standup

# 3. Check configuration
bragdoc standup status
# Shows:
# - Standup name and schedule
# - Number of enrolled projects
# - List of project names

# 4. Test manual extraction
bragdoc standup wip
# Extracts from both projects and submits to web app
```

### Monitoring Your Schedules

Check your automatic extractions using platform-specific tools:

**Linux/macOS**

```bash
# View your scheduled extractions
crontab -l

# Check cron service is running
ps aux | grep cron
```

**Windows**

```bash
# View your scheduled tasks
schtasks /query /tn BragDoc*

# Open Task Scheduler GUI for visual management
taskschd.msc
```

### Cache Management (`cache`)

Manage the local commit cache to optimize performance.

```bash
# List cached commits
bragdoc cache list
bragdoc cache list --stats

# Clear cache
bragdoc cache clear              # Clear current project's cache
bragdoc cache clear --all        # Clear all cached data
bragdoc cache clear --project name  # Clear specific project's cache
```

### Data Management (`data`)

Manage the local cache of companies, projects, and standups data. The CLI automatically caches this data to reduce API calls and improve performance.

```bash
# Fetch all data from API (force refresh)
bragdoc data fetch

# Clear all cached data
bragdoc data clear
```

**Cache Timeout**: By default, cached data is refreshed every 5 minutes. You can configure this in your config file using the `dataCacheTimeout` setting (in minutes).

The data cache is stored in `~/.bragdoc/cache/` and includes:

- `companies.yml` - Your companies
- `projects.yml` - Your projects
- `standups.yml` - Your standups
- `meta.yml` - Cache metadata and timestamps

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.bragdoc/config.yml`:

- Authentication tokens
- Project settings and schedules
- Commit cache locations
- API configuration

## Automated Workflow Example

Here's how to set up fully automated achievement tracking:

```bash
# 1. Install and authenticate
npm install -g @bragdoc/cli
bragdoc login

# 2. Initialize your projects with scheduling
cd ~/work/frontend-app
bragdoc init --name "Frontend App"
# Choose "Daily" ‚Üí Enter "18:00" ‚Üí Automatically installs to crontab

cd ~/work/backend-api
bragdoc init --name "Backend API"
# Choose "Hourly" ‚Üí Enter "0" ‚Üí Automatically updates crontab

cd ~/work/mobile-app
bragdoc init --name "Mobile App"
# Choose "Daily" ‚Üí Enter "09:00" ‚Üí Automatically updates crontab

# 3. Your achievements are now automatically extracted:
# - Frontend App: Daily at 6:00 PM
# - Backend API: Every hour on the hour
# - Mobile App: Daily at 9:00 AM
```

## Best Practices

1. **Automatic Scheduling**:

   - Set daily extractions for active projects
   - Use hourly for rapidly evolving projects
   - Schedule during off-hours to avoid interruption

2. **Project Organization**:

   - Add projects you actively contribute to
   - Use meaningful project names
   - Set appropriate max-commit limits (100-500)

3. **Schedule Management**:

   - Use system-level scheduling for reliability
   - Check system logs if extractions fail
   - Re-run installation commands to update schedules

4. **Cache Management**:
   - The cache prevents re-processing of commits
   - Clear cache if you need to re-process commits
   - Use `cache list --stats` to monitor cache size

## Error Handling

The CLI provides detailed error messages and logging:

- Authentication errors
- Project validation issues
- API communication problems
- Cache-related errors

## Environment Variables

- `BRAGDOC_API_URL`: Override the API endpoint
- `BRAGDOC_DEBUG`: Enable debug logging

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Issues**

   - Ensure you're logged in: `bragdoc auth status`
   - Try logging out and back in
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Project Issues**

   - Verify project path exists
   - Ensure project has a remote URL
   - Check project permissions

3. **Extraction Issues**

   - Verify project is enabled: `bragdoc projects list`
   - Check max-commits setting
   - Try clearing the cache

4. **Scheduling Issues**

   - **Linux/macOS**: Check crontab with `crontab -l`
   - **Windows**: Check tasks with `schtasks /query /tn BragDoc*`
   - Verify system scheduling permissions
   - Check extraction logs in system scheduler
   - Check that system scheduling was properly set up automatically

5. **System Integration Issues**
   - **Windows**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator for task creation
   - **macOS**: Check LaunchAgent with `launchctl list | grep bragdoc`
   - **Linux**: Verify systemd user services are enabled
