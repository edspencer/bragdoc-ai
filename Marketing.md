## Marketing

### Email Pro offer

24 hours after someone signs up for a free account, email them with an offer for 30 free days of bragdoc.ai Pro. They just have to click a button to claim their offer. It doesn't take any credit card info.

### Email campaign

Design a campaign of emails that will be sent out to the user introducing them to the bragdoc.ai features.
This can easily become annoying so be careful on frequency.
Maybe it can be personalized with a weekly summary of their activity?
Should this be separate from the weekly review/update email?

#### Stripe email example

After I made a Payment Link, the next day I got this email from Stripe. Seemed a good excuse for a touch point:

Now that you've created a payment link, there are several ways you can share it with your customers:

- Add a buy button to your site
- Generate a QR code
- Share the link online, on social media, or via SMS or email
