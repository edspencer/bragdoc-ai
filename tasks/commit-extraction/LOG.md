### Phase 2: Git Operations Enhancement

Started: 2025-10-21

#### Overview

Phase 2 implements the core extraction functionality by adding diff parsing utilities, stats parsing, and enhanced commit collection functions. This phase enables the CLI to optionally extract file statistics and code diffs from git commits.

Tasks:
1. Create diff-parsing.ts with utilities for parsing and limiting diffs
2. Add parseNumstat function to operations.ts for parsing git --numstat output
3. Add enhanced commit collection functions to operations.ts

#### Task 2.1: Add Diff Parsing Utilities

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/git/diff-parsing.ts` (new file)
- Changes Made:
  - Created `splitDiffByFile()` function to parse unified diff output into per-file blocks
  - Implemented `matchesPattern()` helper for simple glob-style pattern matching (supports `**` for subdirs, `*` for any chars)
  - Created `prioritizeDiffBlocks()` function to filter and prioritize diff blocks based on exclude/priority patterns
  - Implemented `limitDiffSize()` function to apply size limits (per-file, per-commit, max files) with truncation support
  - All functions properly handle edge cases (empty diffs, binary files, size limits)
- Verification: File compiles without errors, follows modular design for testability

#### Task 2.2: Add Stats Parsing Utility

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/git/operations.ts`
- Changes Made:
  - Added imports for new types: `FileStats`, `ExtractionConfig`
  - Added imports for extraction-presets and diff-parsing utilities
  - Implemented `parseNumstat()` function to parse git --numstat output
  - Handles binary files (shown as "-" in numstat output) by setting additions/deletions to 0
  - Properly filters empty lines and validates tab-separated format
- Verification: Function follows existing code patterns, handles all edge cases

#### Task 2.3: Add Enhanced Commit Collection Functions

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/git/operations.ts`
- Changes Made:
  - Implemented `enhanceCommitsWithStats()` function that:
    - Maps over commits and runs `git show --numstat` for each
    - Parses numstat output using parseNumstat()
    - Returns enhanced commits with stats field populated
    - Gracefully handles errors by returning unmodified commit
  - Implemented `enhanceCommitsWithDiffs()` function that:
    - Maps over commits and runs `git show -p` for each
    - Parses diff output using splitDiffByFile()
    - Applies prioritization via prioritizeDiffBlocks()
    - Applies size limits via limitDiffSize()
    - Returns enhanced commits with diff and diffTruncated fields
    - Gracefully handles errors by returning unmodified commit
  - Implemented `collectGitCommitsEnhanced()` function that:
    - Calls existing collectGitCommits() for base commit data
    - Resolves extraction config using resolveExtractionConfig()
    - Conditionally enhances with stats if config.includeStats is true
    - Conditionally enhances with diffs if config.includeDiff is true
    - Returns fully enhanced commits
- Verification: All functions follow existing patterns, use proper error handling

---

### Phase 2 Summary

Completed: 2025-10-21

All Phase 2 tasks completed successfully:
- ✅ Created diff-parsing.ts with modular parsing utilities
- ✅ Added parseNumstat function for stats extraction
- ✅ Added enhanced commit collection functions

Key Implementation Decisions:
- Split diff parsing into three separate functions (splitDiffByFile, prioritizeDiffBlocks, limitDiffSize) for better modularity and testability
- Used graceful error handling in enhancement functions - if stats/diff extraction fails for a commit, return the unmodified commit rather than failing the entire batch
- Implemented simple glob pattern matching rather than pulling in a full glob library to minimize dependencies
- Applied size limits progressively: per-file limit first, then per-commit limit, then max files limit

No issues encountered. All functions integrate cleanly with existing code.

### Verification

- Status: Complete
- Tests Run:
  - ✅ `pnpm run format` - All files formatted, 3 CLI files auto-fixed by Biome
  - ✅ `pnpm run lint` - All packages pass linting with no issues
  - ✅ CLI build - TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
  - ✅ CLI tests - All 6 test suites pass (54 tests passed, 1 skipped)
- Issues:
  - Web tests failed due to missing database configuration (pre-existing issue, not related to our changes)
- Final State:
  - All Phase 2 tasks complete and verified
  - All new code compiles without errors
  - All existing CLI tests still pass
  - Code is properly formatted and linted
  - Backward compatibility maintained (enhanced collection is opt-in via new function)

Next Steps: Phase 3 will be implemented in a separate step (Extract Command Updates).

### Phase 3: Extract Command Updates

Started: 2025-10-21

#### Overview

Phase 3 integrates the enhanced extraction functionality into the extract command by adding CLI options, configuration resolution logic, and updating the command to use the new `collectGitCommitsEnhanced()` function.

Tasks:
1. Add CLI options for detail levels (--detail-level, --include-stats, --include-diff)
2. Add configuration resolution logic to merge CLI options with project/global config
3. Update commit collection to use enhanced function
4. Update dry-run display to show stats and diffs

#### Task 3.1: Add CLI Options

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/commands/extract.ts`
- Changes Made:
  - Added import for `Option` from commander
  - Added `--detail-level <level>` option using `.addOption()` with `.choices()` for validation (accepts: minimal, standard, detailed, comprehensive)
  - Added `--include-stats` boolean flag to include file change statistics
  - Added `--include-diff` boolean flag to include code diffs
  - Updated options destructuring to extract new CLI options: `detailLevel`, `includeStats`, `includeDiff`
- Verification: Commander will automatically validate detail level choices and reject invalid values

#### Task 3.2: Add Configuration Resolution Logic

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/commands/extract.ts`
- Changes Made:
  - Added imports for `ExtractionConfig` type and `resolveExtractionConfig` function
  - Added import for `collectGitCommitsEnhanced` function
  - Implemented `getExtractionConfigForProject()` helper function that:
    - Merges configuration from three sources: global defaults, project config, CLI options
    - Follows priority chain: CLI options > Project config > Global defaults
    - Uses Object.assign to merge configurations layer by layer
    - Returns merged ExtractionConfig object
- Verification: Function properly implements priority chain as specified in plan

#### Task 3.3: Use Enhanced Collection

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/commands/extract.ts`
- Changes Made:
  - Added configuration resolution before commit collection:
    - Calls `getExtractionConfigForProject()` to merge config from all sources
    - Calls `resolveExtractionConfig()` to resolve presets and get final config
    - Determines whether to use enhanced collection based on `includeStats` or `includeDiff`
  - Added logging for extraction mode:
    - Logs when enhanced extraction is being used with stats/diff flags
    - Logs debug info about diff limits when diffs are enabled
  - Updated commit collection to conditionally use enhanced function:
    - Uses `collectGitCommitsEnhanced()` when enhanced data is requested
    - Falls back to `collectGitCommits()` for standard extraction (backward compatible)
    - Passes `extractionConfig` to enhanced function
- Verification: Logic correctly switches between standard and enhanced collection based on configuration

#### Task 3.4: Update Dry Run Display

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/commands/extract.ts`
- Changes Made:
  - Completely rewrote `formatCommit()` function to handle enhanced data:
    - Restructured to use an array of parts that are joined at the end
    - Added conditional section for file statistics (when `commit.stats` is present):
      - Shows "File Statistics:" header
      - Lists each file with additions/deletions count
    - Added conditional section for code changes (when `commit.diff` is present):
      - Shows "Code Changes:" header
      - Lists each file with line count and truncation status
      - Shows note if some files were omitted due to size limits
    - Maintains backward compatibility - only shows enhanced sections if data is present
- Verification: Function handles all three cases: minimal (messages only), with stats, with diffs

---

### Phase 3 Summary

Completed: 2025-10-21

All Phase 3 tasks completed successfully:
- ✅ Added CLI options for detail levels and fine-grained control
- ✅ Implemented configuration resolution with correct priority chain
- ✅ Updated commit collection to use enhanced function conditionally
- ✅ Enhanced dry-run display to show stats and diffs

Key Implementation Decisions:
- Used Commander's `.addOption()` with `.choices()` for detail level validation rather than manual validation
- Configuration resolution follows clear priority chain: CLI > Project > Global defaults
- Enhanced collection is opt-in - only used when `includeStats` or `includeDiff` is true
- Dry-run display is backward compatible - only shows enhanced sections when data is present
- Added informative logging to show extraction mode and diff limits

No issues encountered. All changes integrate seamlessly with existing command structure.

### Verification

- Status: Complete
- Tests Run:
  - ✅ `pnpm run format` - All files formatted, 1 CLI file auto-fixed by Biome
  - ✅ `pnpm run lint` - All packages pass linting with no issues
  - ✅ CLI build - TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
  - ✅ CLI tests - All 6 test suites pass (54 tests passed, 1 skipped)
- Final State:
  - All Phase 3 tasks complete and verified
  - All new code compiles without errors
  - All existing CLI tests still pass
  - Code is properly formatted and linted
  - Backward compatibility maintained (existing behavior unchanged when new options not used)
  - Extract command now fully supports configurable extraction detail levels

Phase 3 is complete. The extract command is now fully integrated with the enhanced extraction functionality. Next steps would be Phase 4 (Prompt Component Updates) if implementing the full plan.

---

### Phase 4: Prompt Component Updates

Started: 2025-10-21

#### Overview

Phase 4 updates the prompt components to support rendering the enhanced commit data (stats and diffs) that we're now collecting. This enables the LLM to receive and use the richer context for better achievement extraction.

Tasks:
1. Add JSX type declarations for file-stats and diff elements
2. Add new prompt components (FileStats, Diff)
3. Update Commit component to render stats/diffs when available
4. Update MDX prompt instructions to guide LLM on using enhanced data

#### Task 4.1: Add JSX Type Declarations

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/ai/prompts/elements.tsx`
- Changes Made:
  - Added JSX intrinsic elements to global namespace declaration:
    - `file-stats`, `file-stat` for file statistics
    - `path`, `additions`, `deletions` for stat details
    - `file-diff`, `diff-content` for code diffs
    - `note` for truncation notices
  - All new elements follow the same pattern as existing custom elements
- Verification: TypeScript accepts the new element types without errors

#### Task 4.2: Add New Prompt Components

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/ai/prompts/elements.tsx`
- Changes Made:
  - Added imports for `FileStats` and `FileDiff` types from `../../git/types`
  - Implemented `FileStats` component:
    - Takes optional `stats` array prop
    - Returns null if no stats provided (graceful handling)
    - Renders `<file-stats>` wrapper with nested `<file-stat>` elements
    - Each stat shows path, additions, and deletions
  - Implemented `Diff` component:
    - Takes optional `diffs` array and `truncated` boolean props
    - Returns null if no diffs provided (graceful handling)
    - Renders `<file-diff>` elements for each file
    - Shows `<note>` for truncated individual files
    - Shows `<note>` for overall truncation if some files omitted
  - Both components use `@ts-ignore` comments for custom JSX elements
- Verification: Components compile without errors, follow existing patterns

#### Task 4.3: Update Commit Component

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/ai/prompts/elements.tsx`
- Changes Made:
  - Updated `Commit` component to conditionally render enhanced data:
    - Added `{commit?.stats && <FileStats stats={commit.stats} />}` after date element
    - Added `{commit?.diff && <Diff diffs={commit.diff} truncated={commit.diffTruncated} />}` after stats
  - Uses optional chaining to safely access potentially undefined fields
  - Maintains backward compatibility - only renders when data is present
- Verification: Component properly integrates FileStats and Diff components

#### Task 4.4: Update MDX Prompt Instructions

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified:
  - `/Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/packages/cli/src/ai/prompts/extract-commit-achievements.mdx`
- Changes Made:
  - Added three new `<Instruction>` elements to guide LLM:
    1. Instructions for using file statistics:
       - Understand scale and scope of changes
       - Use file count as indicator of affected systems
       - Consider large line changes as significant refactoring/features
       - Observe which files were modified together
    2. Instructions for using code diffs:
       - Analyze actual code changes for technical details
       - Identify specific functions, classes, modules, APIs
       - Use technical details for specific achievement descriptions
       - Consider complexity when assessing impact
       - Handle truncated diffs appropriately
    3. Instructions for using both stats and diffs together:
       - Stats for overall scope (files, lines)
       - Diffs for specific technical changes
       - Combine both for comprehensive descriptions
  - Inserted after existing instructions, before closing `</Instructions>` tag
- Verification: MDX file structure remains valid, instructions are clear
