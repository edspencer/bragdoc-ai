Add configurable extraction detail levels to BragDoc CLI with optional file statistics and code diffs

This change enhances the git commit extraction system to optionally include file change statistics (--numstat) and code diffs (-p) when extracting achievements from commits. Four preset detail levels are introduced: minimal (messages only), standard (messages + stats), detailed (limited diffs), and comprehensive (extensive diffs). Users can configure extraction detail levels globally in settings, per-project in the config file, or via CLI options, with CLI options taking highest priority.

The implementation adds intelligent diff size limiting to prevent excessive LLM context, including per-file limits, per-commit limits, and file count limits. A pattern-based filtering system allows excluding files (like lock files and build artifacts) and prioritizing important files (like source code directories). The diff parsing system splits unified diff output into per-file blocks, applies prioritization and exclusion rules, and truncates oversized diffs with clear indicators.

New configuration types (ExtractionConfig, ExtractionDetailLevel) are added to packages/cli/src/config/types.ts, with preset definitions in a new extraction-presets.ts file. Git types are extended with FileStats and FileDiff interfaces. The collectGitCommitsEnhanced() function in git/operations.ts provides the enhanced collection logic, while new diff parsing utilities in git/diff-parsing.ts handle the complex diff processing. The extract command gains --detail-level, --include-stats, and --include-diff CLI options with proper configuration resolution.

Prompt components are updated to render the enhanced data: new FileStats and Diff components display file statistics and code changes, while the Commit component conditionally includes them. The MDX extraction prompt receives new instructions for interpreting file statistics and code diffs to improve achievement extraction quality.
