Task: Add Careers section to side-nav

## Specific Requirements

I want to restructure the side-nav to:

- Remove the Documents section entirely
- Add a new section in its place, with the header "Careers"
- In the Careers section should be 4 links:
  - Standup (move existing standup link here)
  - For my manager (move existing here)
  - Performance Review (/performance)
  - Workstreams (/workstreams)
- For both /workstreams and /performance, just create a page.tsx with a nice coming soon message. For the workstreams coming soon, check out tasks/workstreams/SPEC.md for more details so you can give the user a sense of what's coming.
