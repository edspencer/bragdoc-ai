# For my manager UX

Let's rename the "Analytics" item on the left nav to "For my manager". Have it link to a new page that allows the user to view, edit and create various types of documents with the help of AI. The documents are all generated from achievements and aimed at the user's manager.

## Reports Page

On this new page, which should have the url /reports, but navigation called "For my manager", we want to have some buttons in a toolbar up top for creating Weekly, Monthly and Custom documents.

Underneath this toolbar should be a table of existing Reports. Reports have this type in the database:

```typescript
export const document = pgTable(
  'Document',
  {
    id: uuid('id').notNull().defaultRandom(),
    createdAt: timestamp('createdAt').notNull(),
    updatedAt: timestamp('updatedAt').notNull().defaultNow(),
    title: text('title').notNull(),
    content: text('content'),
    userId: uuid('userId')
      .notNull()
      .references(() => user.id),
    companyId: uuid('company_id').references(() => company.id),
    type: varchar('type', { length: 32 }), // weekly_report, performance_review, etc.
    shareToken: varchar('share_token', { length: 64 }), // null if not shared
  },
  (table) => {
    return {
      pk: primaryKey({ columns: [table.id, table.createdAt] }),
      relations: {
        company: {
          fields: [table.companyId],
          references: [company.id],
        },
        user: {
          fields: [table.userId],
          references: [user.id],
        },
      },
    };
  }
);
```

The `type` can technically be anything, but lets use 'weekly_report', 'monthly_report', 'custom_report' for now. So the table of Reports should show the title and type, as well as the updatedAt ("Last Edited") in "3 hours ago" format.

We should have filters above the table to filter Documents by type, company, and timeframe (last week, last 30 days, last 12 months, all time).

Each Document should have a trashcan button to delete it, that shows a Dialog first. There should not be any document viewing or editing capability at the moment.

## New Report pages

Each of the toolbar buttons on the Reports Page goes to a new url, like /reports/new/weekly, /reports/new/monthly, /reports/new/custom, which has a pre-filled prompt that will be submitted but may be modified, and also a list of the Achievements that will be used to generate the document.

I think the UI for each of those /reports/new/ urls should be the same, with the only difference being the pre-filled prompt and the date range used to select the Achievements. The Achievements table presented should also have filters to allow the user to filter down to certain companies or projects. Each Achievement should have a checkbox, with a checkbox in the table header to select all. They should all be selected by default.

There should be a button that generates the document. This is probably a multi-second process, so it should communicate to the user that it's in progress. When it's done, it should go back to the /reports page.
