# Import Reports Implementation Log

## 2025-10-14 - Starting Implementation

### Initial Analysis

Reviewed the plan document and v0 source files. Key findings:

1. **V0 pages structure**:
   - Reports listing page: `tmp/v0-app/app/reports/page.tsx`
   - New report page: `tmp/v0-app/app/reports/new/[type]/page.tsx`
   - Both include their own layout components (SidebarProvider, AppSidebar, SiteHeader)

2. **Main app structure**:
   - No `(app)/layout.tsx` exists, apps use `AppPage` component pattern
   - AppPage is at `apps/web/components/shared/app-page.tsx`
   - It provides SidebarProvider and AppSidebar wrapper

3. **Existing infrastructure**:
   - `/api/documents` GET/POST exists
   - `/api/documents/[id]` DELETE exists
   - `lib/ai/generate-document.ts` has all core generation logic
   - All UI components from shadcn/ui are available

### Implementation Strategy

Will follow the plan but adapt for AppPage pattern:
1. Create directory structure
2. Add sidebar navigation
3. Port reports listing page (remove layout, use AppPage)
4. Port new report page (remove layout, use AppPage)
5. Create `/api/documents/generate` endpoint
6. Test complete flow

### Key Decisions

- **Layout pattern**: Will use AppPage component instead of custom layout
- **Data fetching**: Reports listing will be a Server Component fetching on server, with client component for interactivity
- **New report page**: Will be a Client Component (needs state for filters, selection)
- **API approach**: Will create new `/api/documents/generate` endpoint that leverages existing `generate-document.ts`

Starting implementation now...

## Implementation Complete

### What was built

1. **Directory structure** ✓
   - Created `apps/web/app/(app)/reports/` directory structure
   - Created `apps/web/app/(app)/reports/new/[type]/` for dynamic type routes

2. **Sidebar navigation** ✓
   - Added "For my manager" menu item to `app-sidebar.tsx`
   - Imported and added `IconUserCheck` icon
   - Links to `/reports`

3. **Reports listing page** ✓
   - Server Component: `apps/web/app/(app)/reports/page.tsx`
   - Fetches documents and companies on the server
   - Client Component: `apps/web/app/(app)/reports/reports-table.tsx`
   - Implements filters (type, company, time period)
   - Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
   - Uses AppPage pattern with SidebarInset

4. **New report page** ✓
   - Client Component: `apps/web/app/(app)/reports/new/[type]/page.tsx`
   - Fetches achievements, projects, companies on mount
   - Filters by date range based on report type (weekly/monthly/custom)
   - Project and company filters
   - Achievement selection with checkboxes
   - Editable prompt textarea
   - Generate button calls `/api/documents/generate`

5. **Document generation API** ✓
   - Endpoint: `apps/web/app/api/documents/generate/route.ts`
   - Validates request with Zod schema
   - Fetches selected achievements with relations
   - Formats achievements as text
   - Combines custom prompt with achievement data
   - Uses existing `execute()` function from `lib/ai/generate-document.ts`
   - Streams AI response and collects full content
   - Saves document to database
   - Returns created document

### Deviations from plan

1. **Layout pattern**: Used `AppPage` component wrapper instead of creating a custom layout, which is consistent with other pages in the app.

2. **Simplified AI integration**: Used the existing `execute()` function directly instead of creating a new `generateWithCustomPrompt()` helper. The implementation formats achievements as markdown text and combines with the custom prompt, which is simpler and more maintainable.

3. **Data fetching**: The new report page fetches all data client-side on mount instead of using Server Components, which is necessary because it needs to be a Client Component for interactivity.

### Build verification

- TypeScript compilation: ✓ No errors in new code
- Next.js build: ✓ Successful
- New routes visible in build output:
  - `/reports` (5.84 kB)
  - `/reports/new/[type]` (4.96 kB)
  - `/api/documents/generate`

### Testing recommendations

To fully test:
1. Navigate to "For my manager" from sidebar
2. Verify reports list shows existing documents
3. Test filters (type, company, time period)
4. Click "Weekly" button
5. Verify achievements from last 7 days are shown
6. Test project/company filters
7. Select/deselect achievements
8. Edit prompt
9. Click "Generate Report"
10. Verify redirect to reports list
11. Verify new document appears
12. Test delete functionality

## Summary

Implementation is complete and ready for testing. All core functionality has been implemented:

✓ **Navigation**: "For my manager" menu item added to sidebar
✓ **Reports listing**: Server Component with client-side filters and delete
✓ **New report creation**: Client Component with achievement selection and prompt customization
✓ **API endpoint**: `/api/documents/generate` for AI-powered document generation
✓ **Build verification**: TypeScript compiles, Next.js builds successfully

**Files created:**

## 2025-10-14 - Improvements: Using fetchRenderExecute

### Changes Made

Refactored the document generation to use the proper MDX prompt template instead of custom prompt strings:

1. **Updated `GenerateDocumentFetcherProps` type** (`lib/ai/prompts/types.ts`)
   - Added optional `achievementIds?: string[]` parameter
   - Made `days` optional (defaults to 7)
   - When `achievementIds` is provided, it overrides date-based filtering

2. **Updated `fetch()` function** (`lib/ai/generate-document.ts`)
   - Added logic to handle both modes:
     - If `achievementIds` provided: fetch all achievements and filter client-side by IDs
     - If not provided: use existing date-based filtering (backward compatible)

3. **Refactored API endpoint** (`app/api/documents/generate/route.ts`)
   - Now uses `fetchRenderExecute()` instead of manual `execute()`
   - Removed manual achievement fetching and formatting
   - Removed `prompt` field from schema (now uses MDX template)
   - Much simpler: just 3 lines instead of 60+

4. **Simplified frontend** (`app/(app)/reports/new/[type]/page.tsx`)
   - Removed custom prompt UI (textarea)
   - Removed `prompt` state and PROMPTS constants
   - Removed `prompt` from API request
   - Updated description text
   - Reduced bundle size: 4.41 kB (was 4.96 kB)

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: All document generation now uses the same MDX template
- **Better prompts**: Leverages the carefully crafted MDX template with proper formatting
- **Less code**: API endpoint is much simpler and more maintainable
- **User instructions**: Respects user's document instructions from preferences
- **Backward compatible**: Existing code using date-based filtering still works

### Build Verification ✓

- TypeScript compilation: No errors
- Next.js build: Successful
- Bundle size reduced on new report page

## 2025-10-14 - Final Implementation: User Instructions

### Changes Made

Added back user instructions functionality with proper preference handling and persistence:

1. **Extended types** (`lib/ai/prompts/types.ts`)
   - Added `userInstructions?: string` to `GenerateDocumentFetcherProps`

2. **Updated fetch function** (`lib/ai/generate-document.ts`)
   - Uses provided `userInstructions` if present
   - Falls back to `user.preferences.documentInstructions`
   - Falls back to empty string if neither provided

3. **Enhanced API endpoint** (`app/api/documents/generate/route.ts`)
   - Accepts `userInstructions` and `defaultInstructions` in request
   - Compares user input with defaults
   - If different from both default AND current saved preference:
     - Updates `user.preferences.documentInstructions` in database
   - Passes `userInstructions` to `fetchRenderExecute()`

4. **Restored UI with smart defaults** (`app/(app)/reports/new/[type]/page.tsx`)
   - Added back "Generation Instructions" card with textarea
   - Fetches user session with `useSession()`
   - Shows saved `user.preferences.documentInstructions` if exists
   - Otherwise shows default instructions for report type (weekly/monthly/custom)
   - Updates when session loads or report type changes
   - Sends both `userInstructions` and `defaultInstructions` to API

### How It Works

**First-time user flow:**
1. User opens weekly report page
2. Textarea shows default weekly instructions
3. User can customize or leave as-is
4. On generate, if customized, saves to preferences
5. Next time, shows their saved instructions

**Returning user flow:**
1. User has saved preferences
2. Textarea shows their saved instructions on all report types
3. Can edit per-report or keep saved version
4. Changes save back to preferences if different

**Smart saving logic:**
- Only saves when instructions differ from BOTH:
  - The default for that report type
  - The currently saved preference
- Prevents unnecessary DB updates
- Respects user's intent to customize

### Build Verification ✓

- TypeScript compilation: No errors
- Next.js build: Successful
- Bundle size: 5.1 kB (includes instructions UI)

## 2025-10-14 - Bugfix: Date Filtering

### Issue
Weekly/monthly report pages were showing ALL achievements instead of just those from the relevant time period.

### Root Cause
The `getAchievements()` database query uses `between(achievement.eventStart, startDate, endDate)` which requires BOTH dates. The frontend was only passing `startDate`, so the condition was never applied.

### Fix
Updated the frontend fetch call to include `endDate` set to current time:

```typescript
const now = new Date();
fetch(
  `/api/achievements?startDate=${dateThreshold.toISOString()}&endDate=${now.toISOString()}&limit=200`,
)
```

### Result
- Weekly reports now correctly show achievements from last 7 days
- Monthly reports now correctly show achievements from last 30 days
- Custom reports still show all achievements (dateThreshold = new Date(0))

### Build Verification ✓
- Build successful
- Bundle size: 5.11 kB

## 2025-10-14 - Bugfix: Projects and Companies Dropdowns

### Issue
Projects and companies dropdown filters on the new report pages (`/reports/new/weekly`, `/reports/new/monthly`, `/reports/new/custom`) were not being populated with data.

### Root Cause
API response structure inconsistency:
- Achievements API returns: `{ achievements: [...], pagination: {...} }` (wrapped object)
- Projects API returns: `projects` array directly (NOT wrapped)
- Companies API returns: `companies` array directly (NOT wrapped)

The frontend code was expecting all three APIs to return wrapped objects:
```typescript
setProjects(projectsData.projects || []); // WRONG - projectsData.projects is undefined
setCompanies(companiesData.companies || []); // WRONG - companiesData.companies is undefined
```

When `projectsData` IS the array itself, accessing `.projects` returns `undefined`, resulting in empty dropdowns.

### Fix
Updated the frontend state setters to handle unwrapped arrays correctly:

```typescript
setAchievements(achievementsData.achievements || []); // Still wrapped
setProjects(projectsData || []); // API returns array directly
setCompanies(companiesData || []); // API returns array directly
```

**File changed:** `apps/web/app/(app)/reports/new/[type]/page.tsx` lines 192-193

### Result
- Projects dropdown now correctly shows all user's projects
- Companies dropdown now correctly shows all user's companies
- Filtering by project/company works as expected

### Build Verification ✓
- Build successful
- Bundle size: 5.11 kB

## 2025-10-14 - Enhancement: Active Sidebar State

### Issue
The "For my manager" sidebar item was only showing as active on the exact `/reports` page, but not on nested pages like `/reports/new/weekly`, `/reports/new/monthly`, or `/reports/new/custom`.

### Root Cause
The NavMain component used exact pathname matching:
```typescript
const isActive = pathname === item.url;
```

This only returns true for exact matches, so `/reports/new/weekly` wouldn't match `/reports`.

### Fix
Updated NavMain component to use prefix matching instead:
```typescript
const isActive = pathname.startsWith(item.url);
```

**File changed:** `apps/web/components/nav-main.tsx` line 31

### Result
- "For my manager" now shows as active on `/reports`
- Also shows as active on all nested pages: `/reports/new/weekly`, `/reports/new/monthly`, `/reports/new/custom`
- Works for all sidebar items automatically (e.g., `/achievements` and `/achievements/[id]`)

### Build Verification ✓
- Build successful
