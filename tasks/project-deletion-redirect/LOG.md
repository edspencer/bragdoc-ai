# Implementation Log

## Execution Started: 2025-10-17T00:00:00Z

### Plan Summary

Fixing two issues with project deletion:
1. Wrong redirect destination - users redirected to `/projects` instead of `/dashboard`
2. Stale side navigation - deleted project remains visible until manual refresh

Solution: Add `router.refresh()` before redirect and change destination to `/dashboard`.

### Phase 1: Fix Redirect Destination and Add Router Refresh

Started: 2025-10-17T00:00:00Z

#### Task 1.1: Update redirect destination to /dashboard

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified: `/Users/ed/Code/brag-ai/apps/web/components/project-details-content.tsx`
- Changes Made: Changed `router.push('/projects')` to `router.push('/dashboard')` on line 148
- Issues Encountered: None
- Resolution: N/A
- Verification: Code review - confirmed change is present at line 148

#### Task 1.2: Add router.refresh() to revalidate page data

- Status: Complete
- Files Modified: `/Users/ed/Code/brag-ai/apps/web/components/project-details-content.tsx`
- Changes Made: Added `router.refresh()` at line 147, immediately before `router.push('/dashboard')` to force Next.js to revalidate all Server Components and SWR caches, ensuring the side navigation updates to remove the deleted project
- Issues Encountered: None
- Resolution: N/A
- Verification: Code review - confirmed `router.refresh()` is called before navigation

Completed: 2025-10-17T00:00:00Z

### Overall Status

- Total Tasks: 2
- Completed: 2
- Remaining: 0
- Blockers: None

### Phase 1 Summary

Phase 1 has been completed successfully. The following changes were made to `/Users/ed/Code/brag-ai/apps/web/components/project-details-content.tsx`:

**Line 147**: Added `router.refresh();` to revalidate page data
**Line 148**: Changed `router.push('/projects');` to `router.push('/dashboard');`

These minimal changes ensure that:
1. When a project is deleted, Next.js revalidates all Server Component data and SWR caches
2. The side navigation's `useTopProjects()` hook will re-fetch and update
3. Users are redirected to the dashboard instead of the projects page
4. The deleted project is immediately removed from the side navigation without requiring a manual refresh

The implementation follows the exact pattern specified in the plan and maintains all existing error handling and loading states.
