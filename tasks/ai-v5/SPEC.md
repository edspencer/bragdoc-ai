Task: migrate apps/web application from Vercel AI SDK v4 to v5 (npm module "ai")

## Background Reading

Consult this migration guide before you start:

- https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/migration-guides/migration-guide-5-0

## Specific Requirements

- Scan the entire apps/web app for use of "ai" module, create tasks for each occurrence for any updates required.
- If there are any breaking changes in the AI SDK where our usage can't be easily migrated, flag these in a special section near the top of the PLAN.md
- Only do apps/web for now
