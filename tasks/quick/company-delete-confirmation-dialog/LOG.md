# Implementation Log: Company Delete Confirmation Dialog with Cascade Options

## Execution Started: 2025-10-16

### Plan Summary
Implementing an enhanced company deletion flow that:
1. Shows a confirmation dialog with counts of related data (projects, achievements, documents, standups)
2. Allows users to optionally cascade delete related data via checkboxes
3. Provides detailed feedback on what was deleted

### Implementation Approach
Following the plan's bottom-up structure:
- Phase 1: Database layer (queries for counts and cascade deletion)
- Phase 2: API endpoints (GET for counts, enhanced DELETE with cascade options)
- Phase 3: Frontend components (Dialog with checkboxes replacing AlertDialog)
- Phase 4: Testing and verification
- Phase 5: Documentation

## Phase 1: Database Layer Changes

Started: 2025-10-16
Completed: 2025-10-16

### Changes Made

#### Task 1.1: Added TypeScript interfaces
- Added `RelatedDataCounts` interface for counting related data
- Added `CascadeDeleteOptions` interface for cascade delete flags
- Added `DeleteCompanyResult` interface for returning deletion summary
- Location: `/packages/database/src/queries.ts` (lines 787-810)

#### Task 1.2: Added function to count related data
- Created `getCompanyRelatedDataCounts()` function
- Counts projects, achievements, documents, and standups associated with a company
- Validates company ownership before counting
- Location: `/packages/database/src/queries.ts` (lines 812-862)

#### Task 1.3: Updated imports
- Added `standup` and `standupDocument` to schema imports
- Location: `/packages/database/src/queries.ts` (lines 31-32)

#### Task 1.4: Added cascade delete function
- Created `deleteCompanyWithCascade()` function
- Uses transactions to ensure atomicity
- Handles foreign key constraint for standup documents (deletes them before standups)
- Returns detailed counts of deleted items
- Location: `/packages/database/src/queries.ts` (lines 864-965)

#### Task 1.5: Updated exports
- Added exports for new functions and types in `/packages/database/src/index.ts`
- Exported: `getCompanyRelatedDataCounts`, `deleteCompanyWithCascade`
- Exported types: `RelatedDataCounts`, `CascadeDeleteOptions`, `DeleteCompanyResult`

### Verification
- Code follows existing patterns in queries.ts
- All functions use `userId` scoping for security
- Transaction ensures atomicity of cascade delete
- Error handling follows existing conventions

## Phase 2: API Endpoint Updates

Started: 2025-10-16
Completed: 2025-10-16

### Changes Made

#### Task 2.1: Created related-counts API route
- Created new directory: `/apps/web/app/api/companies/[id]/related-counts/`
- Created route file with GET handler
- Returns counts of related data for a company
- Uses authentication via `getAuthUser`
- Location: `/apps/web/app/api/companies/[id]/related-counts/route.ts`

#### Task 2.2: Updated DELETE handler
- Modified DELETE handler in `/apps/web/app/api/companies/[id]/route.ts`
- Parses cascade options from query parameters
- Conditionally uses `deleteCompanyWithCascade` or `deleteCompany`
- Returns JSON response with deletion counts for cascade delete
- Maintains backward compatibility (returns 204 for simple delete)

#### Task 2.3: Added import
- Added `deleteCompanyWithCascade` to imports in route file
- Location: `/apps/web/app/api/companies/[id]/route.ts` (line 7)

### Verification
- API follows RESTful conventions
- Authentication is checked before all operations
- Query parameters are properly parsed from request
- Backward compatible with existing delete behavior
- Error handling follows existing patterns

## Phase 3: Frontend Component Updates

Started: 2025-10-16
Completed: 2025-10-16

### Changes Made

#### Task 3.1: Updated useDeleteCompany hook
- Modified hook to accept optional cascade options parameter
- Builds query parameters from cascade options
- Handles JSON response with deletion counts
- Shows detailed toast messages listing deleted items
- Location: `/apps/web/hooks/use-companies.ts` (lines 119-196)

#### Task 3.2: Added useCompanyRelatedCounts hook
- New hook to fetch related data counts
- Uses SWR with conditional fetching (only when id is provided)
- Returns counts and loading state
- Location: `/apps/web/hooks/use-companies.ts` (lines 198-218)

#### Task 3.3: Rewrote CompanyActions component
- Replaced AlertDialog with Dialog for better control
- Added companyId and companyName as required props
- Added four checkboxes for cascade delete options
- Fetches related data counts when dialog opens
- Resets checkboxes when dialog closes
- Disables checkboxes when count is 0
- Shows loading state while fetching counts
- Location: `/apps/web/components/companies/company-actions.tsx`

#### Task 3.4: Verified Label component exists
- Confirmed label component exists at `/apps/web/components/ui/label.tsx`

#### Task 3.5 & 3.6: Updated component usages
- Updated CompanyList component props interface
- Updated CompanyActions usage in CompanyList
- Updated CompaniesTable component props interface
- Replaced dropdown menu in CompaniesTable with CompanyActions component
- Updated companies page handleDeleteCompany function
- All usages now pass companyId, companyName, and cascade-aware onDelete

### Files Modified
1. `/apps/web/hooks/use-companies.ts` - Updated hooks
2. `/apps/web/components/companies/company-actions.tsx` - Complete rewrite
3. `/apps/web/components/companies/company-list.tsx` - Updated props and usage
4. `/apps/web/components/companies-table.tsx` - Integrated CompanyActions
5. `/apps/web/app/(app)/companies/page.tsx` - Updated delete handler

### Verification
- Component follows existing patterns (Dialog, Checkbox, Label from shadcn/ui)
- Client component directive properly placed
- State management with useState and useEffect
- Conditional rendering for loading states
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
- Maintains existing UI consistency

## Testing

Completed: 2025-10-16

### Test Results
- Ran `pnpm run test` at project root
- All test suites passed: 7 passed, 7 total
- All tests passed: 121 passed (67 web + 54 cli)
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- All packages built successfully

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Built
A comprehensive company deletion feature with optional cascade delete for related data:

1. **Database Layer**:
   - New query functions for counting related data
   - Transaction-based cascade delete with atomicity guarantees
   - Proper foreign key handling (standup documents deleted before standups)

2. **API Layer**:
   - New GET endpoint for fetching related counts
   - Enhanced DELETE endpoint supporting cascade via query parameters
   - Backward compatible (returns 204 for simple delete, JSON for cascade)

3. **Frontend**:
   - Enhanced confirmation dialog with checkboxes
   - Real-time loading of related data counts
   - Disabled checkboxes for zero-count items
   - Detailed success toast showing what was deleted
   - Proper state management and cleanup

### Key Decisions
1. Used Dialog instead of AlertDialog for better control over state
2. Fetched counts only when dialog opens (performance optimization)
3. Made cascade options entirely optional to preserve existing behavior
4. Used query parameters instead of request body for DELETE (RESTful)
5. Showed detailed deletion counts in toast messages

### Testing Notes
Phase 4 (manual testing) should verify:
- Dialog opens and shows correct counts
- Checkboxes enable/disable based on counts
- Cascade deletion works correctly
- Non-cascade deletion preserves data
- Toast messages show correct information
- Dialog resets state when closed and reopened

Phase 5 (documentation) is optional per the plan instructions.
