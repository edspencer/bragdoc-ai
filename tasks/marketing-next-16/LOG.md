# Marketing Site Next.js 16 Upgrade - Implementation Log

## Execution Started: 2025-10-24

### Plan Summary

Upgrading the BragDoc marketing website (`apps/marketing`) from Next.js 15.5.6 to Next.js 16. This is a significantly simpler migration than the main web app upgrade, with:
- No code changes expected (only dependency updates)
- No middleware to rename
- No redirect() usage to fix
- Pure static content site with MDX blog posts
- Expected 2-5√ó faster builds with Turbopack

### Risk Assessment: VERY LOW üü¢

---

## Phase 1: Preparation

Started: 2025-10-24

### Task 1.1: Verify Current State

Status: Complete

**Results:**
- Build succeeded with Next.js 15.5.6 ‚úÖ
- Build time: 14.3s (with webpack)
- 29 static pages generated
- First Load JS: ~102-145 kB
- Working tree clean (only untracked tasks directory)

**Current Versions:**
- `next`: 15.5.6
- `react`: 19.2.0
- `react-dom`: 19.2.0

**Build Output:**
- All pages compiled successfully
- 29 routes generated (static + SSG)
- No errors or warnings

### Task 1.2: Review Web App Migration Lessons

Status: Complete

**Key Lessons Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Check for implicit/transitive dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Verify peer dependency warnings are non-blocking
3. ‚úÖ Run full build test after dependency upgrades
4. ‚úÖ Monitor for Turbopack-specific issues

**Implicit Dependency Check:**
- Marketing uses `tw-animate-css` (properly declared in devDependencies ‚úÖ)
- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- No missing dependencies identified
- Marketing has simpler dependencies than web app (no auth, Stripe, AI SDK, etc.)

**Lessons from Web App Migration:**
- Web app had `tailwindcss-animate` issue (not declared)
- Marketing app is cleaner - all CSS dependencies properly declared
- Peer dependency warnings were non-blocking in web app upgrade
- Turbopack is now default and working well

### Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

**Completed**: 2025-10-24

All preparation tasks complete:
- ‚úÖ Current state verified (build succeeds)
- ‚úÖ Versions documented
- ‚úÖ Web app lessons reviewed
- ‚úÖ No implicit dependencies found
- ‚úÖ Ready to proceed to Phase 2

---

## Phase 2: Dependency Upgrades

Started: 2025-10-24

### Task 2.1: Run Next.js Automated Codemod

Status: In Progress

**Method**: Using `npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest`
**Location**: /Users/ed/Code/bragdoc2/apps/marketing

**Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS

**Dependency Changes:**
- `next`: 15.5.6 ‚Üí 16.0.0 ‚úÖ
- `@next/mdx`: latest ‚Üí 16.0.0 ‚úÖ
- `eslint-config-next`: 15.5.6 ‚Üí 16.0.0 ‚úÖ
- `@types/react`: ^18 ‚Üí 19.2.2 ‚úÖ
- `@types/react-dom`: ^18 ‚Üí 19.2.2 ‚úÖ
- `@vercel/og`: Added 0.8.5 (transitive dependency)
- Added pnpm overrides for React types

**Codemods Applied:**
1. `remove-experimental-ppr`: 0 files modified (as expected - no PPR in marketing)
2. `remove-unstable-prefix`: 0 files modified (as expected)
3. `middleware-to-proxy`: 0 files modified (as expected - no middleware)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/marketing/package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### Task 2.2: Verify Peer Dependency Warnings

Status: Complete

**Peer Dependency Warnings Found:**

1. **eslint-config-next 16.0.0**
   - Requires: eslint@>=9.0.0
   - Found: 8.57.1
   - **Impact**: Non-blocking (cosmetic warning)
   - **Note**: Marketing app already uses eslint 9.38.0, this is a workspace resolution issue

2. **next-auth 5.0.0-beta.29**
   - Requires: next@^14.0.0-0 || ^15.0.0-0
   - Found: 16.0.0
   - **Impact**: Non-blocking (next-auth hasn't updated peer deps yet)
   - **Note**: Marketing app doesn't use next-auth directly (workspace dependency)

3. **react-day-picker 8.10.1**
   - Requires: date-fns@^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0
   - Found: 4.1.0
   - **Impact**: Non-blocking (date-fns is backward compatible)
   - **Note**: Marketing app doesn't use react-day-picker directly

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ All warnings are non-blocking and expected. These are workspace-level dependencies from the web app, not used by marketing.

### Task 2.3: Update Lock File

Status: Complete

The codemod automatically ran `pnpm install` and updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
Lock file updated successfully with no errors.

### Task 2.4: Check for Implicit Dependencies

Status: Complete

Verified in Phase 1 Task 1.2:
- ‚úÖ `tw-animate-css` is properly declared in devDependencies
- ‚úÖ All Tailwind CSS plugins are declared
- ‚úÖ No implicit dependencies found

### Phase 2 Complete ‚úÖ

**Completed**: 2025-10-24

All dependency upgrade tasks complete:
- ‚úÖ Next.js upgraded to 16.0.0
- ‚úÖ Related dependencies upgraded (@next/mdx, eslint-config-next, React types)
- ‚úÖ Peer dependency warnings documented (all non-blocking)
- ‚úÖ Lock file updated
- ‚úÖ No implicit dependencies
- ‚úÖ Ready to proceed to Phase 3

   - Pattern: `const withMDX = createMDX({ ... })`
   - Export: `export default withMDX(nextConfig)`
   - Matches Next.js 16 MDX documentation

2. **Image Optimization**: ‚úÖ
   - Formats explicitly set: AVIF, WebP
   - Device sizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840]
   - Image sizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384]
   - Explicit config overrides Next.js 16 defaults
   - Should continue working as-is

3. **Output Mode**: ‚úÖ
   - `output: 'standalone'` (required for Cloudflare Workers)
   - No changes needed

4. **Page Extensions**: ‚úÖ
   - Includes 'md' and 'mdx' for MDX support
   - Properly configured
   - No changes needed

5. **Build Options**: ‚úÖ
   - ESLint ignored during builds (acceptable for marketing)
   - TypeScript errors ignored during builds (acceptable for marketing)
   - Output file tracing includes public assets

### Task 3.2: Verify No Deprecated Config Options

Status: Complete

**Checked for deprecated options:**
- ‚ùå `experimental.turbopack` - NOT PRESENT ‚úÖ
- ‚ùå `experimental.ppr` - NOT PRESENT ‚úÖ
- ‚ùå `serverRuntimeConfig` - NOT PRESENT ‚úÖ
- ‚ùå `publicRuntimeConfig` - NOT PRESENT ‚úÖ

**Assessment**: ‚úÖ Configuration is clean and Next.js 16 compatible. No changes needed.

- **Resolution**: Removed `eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }` from config
- **Outcome**: Build succeeded without warnings

**TypeScript Errors (Pre-existing, Non-blocking)**:
- **Issue**: 3 errors in `components/pricing/comparison-table.tsx`
- **Error**: `title` prop not valid for Lucide icons
- **Assessment**: Pre-existing, not introduced by upgrade
- **Impact**: None (config has `ignoreBuildErrors: true`)
- **Action**: Documented but not fixed (out of scope)

**Peer Dependency Warnings (Expected, Non-blocking)**:
- eslint-config-next peer dep mismatch (workspace issue)
- next-auth peer dep not updated for Next.js 16 yet
- react-day-picker date-fns version mismatch
- **Impact**: None (cosmetic warnings, packages work correctly)
- **Note**: These are workspace-level dependencies from web app

**No Unexpected Issues**: The upgrade was as straightforward as predicted in the risk assessment.

#### 5. Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**

1. **Automated Codemod Worked Perfectly**:
   - Used `npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest`
   - Upgraded all dependencies correctly
   - Applied all necessary codemods (though none modified files)
   - Much easier than manual dependency updates

2. **Web App Lessons Applied Successfully**:
   - Checked for implicit dependencies (none found)
   - Expected peer dependency warnings (documented)
   - Removed deprecated config options proactively
   - Turbopack worked flawlessly as default

3. **Simpler Architecture = Faster Upgrade**:
   - No middleware to rename (marketing has none)
   - No redirect() to fix (no auth flows)
   - No async params to update (static pages only)
   - Total implementation time: ~1 hour

4. **Documentation Was Comprehensive**:
   - Plan was accurate and detailed
   - Risk assessment was correct (VERY LOW)
   - Success criteria were clear and measurable
   - Lessons from web app migration were valuable

5. **Performance Gains Are Real**:
   - 2.9√ó faster builds are immediately noticeable
   - Turbopack compilation is significantly faster (2.3s)
   - Developer experience improved

**What Could Be Improved:**

1. **Pre-existing TypeScript Errors**:
   - Marketing app has 3 TypeScript errors that should be fixed
   - While non-blocking, they indicate code quality issues
   - Recommendation: Create separate task to fix these

2. **Testing Could Be More Comprehensive**:
   - We verified OpenNext build succeeded
   - But didn't fully test preview server (R2 upload takes time)
   - Manual QA testing was deferred
   - Recommendation: Consider automated E2E tests for marketing

3. **Documentation Could Be Automated**:
   - Manually updating architecture.md, deployment.md, CLAUDE.md
   - Could create a script to update version numbers
   - Recommendation: Consider template-based docs with version variables

**Process Improvements:**

1. **Monorepo Upgrades Should Be Coordinated**:
   - Web app upgraded first, then marketing
   - This sequencing worked well (learned lessons applied)
   - Recommendation: Always upgrade main app first, then simpler apps

2. **Configuration Warnings Should Be Addressed Immediately**:
   - We caught the `eslint` deprecation warning in first build
   - Fixed it immediately before proceeding
   - Recommendation: Always rebuild after fixing warnings to verify

3. **Risk Assessment Was Excellent**:
   - Plan accurately predicted "VERY LOW" risk
   - No surprises encountered
   - Recommendation: Use similar risk assessment framework for future upgrades

#### 6. Documentation Updates

**Files Updated:**
1. `.claude/docs/tech/architecture.md` - Added marketing app Next.js 16 details
2. `.claude/docs/tech/deployment.md` - Added marketing deployment section
3. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated `@bragdoc/marketing` section with Next.js 16 info
4. `tasks/marketing-next-16/PLAN.md` - Marked all tasks complete
5. `tasks/marketing-next-16/LOG.md` - Comprehensive implementation log
6. `apps/marketing/next.config.mjs` - Removed deprecated eslint option

**Gaps Identified:**
- Marketing app lacks automated tests (only manual QA)
- No E2E tests for critical user flows
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors not documented in tech debt

#### 7. Recommendations

**For Future Next.js Upgrades:**

1. **Use Automated Codemod First**:
   - Always try `npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest` first
   - Fall back to manual upgrades only if codemod fails
   - Saves time and ensures consistency

2. **Upgrade in Sequence**:
   - Main app first (learn lessons)
   - Simpler apps second (apply lessons)
   - Document lessons learned in main app LOG.md

3. **Address Deprecation Warnings Immediately**:
   - Don't ignore build warnings
   - Fix deprecated options before proceeding
   - Rebuild to verify warnings are resolved

4. **Performance Metrics Are Valuable**:
   - Document baseline build times
   - Measure improvement after upgrade
   - Include metrics in after-action report

**For Marketing App Specifically:**

1. **Fix Pre-existing TypeScript Errors**:
   - Create task to fix 3 errors in `comparison-table.tsx`
   - Remove `title` props from Lucide icons
   - Enable strict TypeScript checking

2. **Add Automated Tests**:
   - Consider Playwright E2E tests for critical pages
   - Test page loads, navigation, MDX rendering
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

3. **Monitor Build Performance**:
   - Track build times over time
   - Investigate if builds slow down
   - Consider build time budgets

#### 8. Comparison with Web App Upgrade

| Aspect | Web App | Marketing App |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Complexity** | Medium | Very Low |
| **Time** | ~2-3 hours | ~1 hour |
