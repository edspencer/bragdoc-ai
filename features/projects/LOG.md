# Project Management Feature Development Log

## 2024-12-18

### Database and API Layer Implementation 

#### Database Layer
1. Created project table schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`
   - Added required fields: name, userId, status, startDate
   - Added optional fields: description, companyId, endDate
   - Added timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt

2. Implemented project queries in `lib/db/projects/queries.ts`
   - Created CRUD operations with user ownership checks
   - Added company relationship handling
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation

3. Added comprehensive test suite in `test/db/projects/queries.test.ts`
   - Covered all query functions
   - Added edge cases and validation tests
   - Ensured proper user ownership checks

#### API Layer
1. Implemented main project routes in `app/api/projects/route.ts`
   - GET: List user's projects
   - POST: Create new project with validation
   - Added proper error handling and status codes
   - Matched companies route pattern for consistency

2. Implemented project-specific routes in `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`
   - GET: Fetch project details
   - PUT: Update project with validation
   - DELETE: Remove project with ownership check
   - Added proper error responses and status codes

3. Added API test suite in `test/api/projects/route.test.ts`
   - Covered all endpoints and methods
   - Added validation test cases
   - Ensured proper error handling
   - Fixed request handling and response format

### Next Steps
1. Begin UI implementation
   - Create project list component
   - Add project creation modal
   - Implement project detail view

2. Add integration with brags
   - Add project selector to brag creation
   - Update brag list with project filter

3. Add polish features
   - Loading states
   - Success/error toasts
   - Optimistic updates

### Phase 1: Database and API Layer
- âœ… Completed database schema and queries
- âœ… Implemented API routes with proper validation
- âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… Added type definitions in `lib/db/types.ts`

### Phase 2: Core UI Components
- âœ… Created form components:
  - `project-form.tsx`: Form with validation, company selector, status selector, and date pickers
  - `project-dialog.tsx`: Modal wrapper for create/edit modes
- âœ… Created list components:
  - `project-list.tsx`: Table view with sorting, empty state, and loading state
  - `project-actions.tsx`: Edit/delete actions with confirmation
  - `project-list-skeleton.tsx`: Loading placeholder

Key Features Added:
1. Project Form:
   - Validation using Zod
   - Company selection integration
   - Status selection with predefined options
   - Date range selection with validation
   - Proper error handling and loading states

2. Project List:
   - Sortable table view
   - Status badges with color coding
   - Company name display
   - Date formatting
   - Empty state with call-to-action
   - Loading skeleton
   - Animated transitions

3. Project Actions:
   - Dropdown menu for actions
   - Delete confirmation dialog
   - Loading states for actions

### Added Filter Loading States and Error Handling
- Enhanced `useProjectFilters` hook with loading states
  - Added `FilterLoadingStates` interface
  - Implemented async filter operations
  - Added error handling with loading cleanup
  - Added URL parameter validation

- Updated `ProjectFilters` component
  - Added loading spinners
  - Added disabled states
  - Improved visual feedback
  - Enhanced accessibility

### Error Handling Improvements
1. Added custom ErrorBoundary component
   - Created reusable error boundary with retry functionality
   - Styled using Tailwind and ShadcN UI components
   - Added fallback prop support for custom error states
   - Integrated with project list component for graceful error handling

### Retry Logic Implementation
1. Added `useRetry` hook for handling operation retries
   - Configurable max attempts and delay
   - Tracks retry state and attempt count
   - TypeScript support with generics

2. Enhanced project operations with retry logic
   - Added automatic retries for create/update/delete operations
   - Improved error messages for retry failures
   - Maintained consistent error handling across operations

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed TypeScript return type mismatch in `components/projects/project-list.tsx`
   - Updated `handleDeleteProject` to properly return `Promise<boolean>` from `onDeleteProject`
   - Maintained loading state management in try/finally block
   - Ensures type safety while preserving functionality

### Main Projects Page Implementation (2024-12-19 16:49 EST)
- âœ… Created main projects page layout
  - Added responsive grid layout
  - Integrated with existing components
  - Added proper routing and navigation
- âœ… Implemented basic data fetching
  - Added API integration
  - Implemented form submissions with Enter key support
  - Added initial error handling
- ðŸ”„ Started work on UX improvements
  - Planning SWR caching implementation
  - Planning enhanced loading states
  - Planning keyboard navigation support

### Next Steps
1. Polish and UX Improvements
   - Add SWR caching for data fetching
   - Enhance loading states across all actions
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Add success/error toasts
   - Add optimistic updates

2. Advanced Features
   - Implement advanced filtering options
   - Add bulk actions support
   - Add analytics and monitoring

### Technical Notes
- Using Zod for URL parameter validation
- Implemented async URL updates with loading states
- Added error boundaries for filter operations
- Enhanced type safety throughout

### Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: Managing multiple loading states
  - Solution: Created separate loading states per filter operation
  - Solution: Added cleanup in error handlers

- Challenge: URL parameter validation
  - Solution: Added Zod schemas for validation
  - Solution: Implemented fallback values for invalid parameters

### Code Quality
- Added TypeScript interfaces for all new components
- Maintained consistent error handling
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Followed project naming conventions
