### Phase 1: Database and API Layer
- âœ… Completed database schema and queries
- âœ… Implemented API routes with proper validation
- âœ… Added comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… Added type definitions in `lib/db/types.ts`

### Phase 2: Core UI Components
- âœ… Created form components:
  - `project-form.tsx`: Form with validation, company selector, status selector, and date pickers
  - `project-dialog.tsx`: Modal wrapper for create/edit modes
- âœ… Created list components:
  - `project-list.tsx`: Table view with sorting, empty state, and loading state
  - `project-actions.tsx`: Edit/delete actions with confirmation
  - `project-list-skeleton.tsx`: Loading placeholder

Key Features Added:
1. Project Form:
   - Validation using Zod
   - Company selection integration
   - Status selection with predefined options
   - Date range selection with validation
   - Proper error handling and loading states

2. Project List:
   - Sortable table view
   - Status badges with color coding
   - Company name display
   - Date formatting
   - Empty state with call-to-action
   - Loading skeleton
   - Animated transitions

3. Project Actions:
   - Dropdown menu for actions
   - Delete confirmation dialog
   - Loading states for actions

### Added Filter Loading States and Error Handling
- Enhanced `useProjectFilters` hook with loading states
  - Added `FilterLoadingStates` interface
  - Implemented async filter operations
  - Added error handling with loading cleanup
  - Added URL parameter validation

- Updated `ProjectFilters` component
  - Added loading spinners
  - Added disabled states
  - Improved visual feedback
  - Enhanced accessibility

### Error Handling Improvements
1. Added custom ErrorBoundary component
   - Created reusable error boundary with retry functionality
   - Styled using Tailwind and ShadcN UI components
   - Added fallback prop support for custom error states
   - Integrated with project list component for graceful error handling

### Success Animation Implementation
1. Added confetti effect for project creation
   - Installed and configured canvas-confetti
   - Created reusable useConfetti hook
   - Implemented multi-stage confetti animation
   - Added to project creation success flow

2. Enhanced user feedback
   - Added success toasts with confetti
   - Improved loading state transitions
   - Added visual feedback for all actions

### Retry Logic Implementation
1. Added `useRetry` hook for handling operation retries
   - Configurable max attempts and delay
   - Tracks retry state and attempt count
   - TypeScript support with generics

2. Enhanced project operations with retry logic
   - Added automatic retries for create/update/delete operations
   - Improved error messages for retry failures
   - Maintained consistent error handling across operations

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed TypeScript return type mismatch in `components/projects/project-list.tsx`
   - Updated `handleDeleteProject` to properly return `Promise<boolean>` from `onDeleteProject`
   - Maintained loading state management in try/finally block
   - Ensures type safety while preserving functionality

### Main Projects Page Implementation (2024-12-19 16:49 EST)
- âœ… Created main projects page layout
  - Added responsive grid layout
  - Integrated with existing components
  - Added proper routing and navigation
- âœ… Implemented basic data fetching
  - Added API integration
  - Implemented form submissions with Enter key support
  - Added initial error handling
- ðŸ”„ Started work on UX improvements
  - Planning SWR caching implementation
  - Planning enhanced loading states
  - Planning keyboard navigation support

### Next Steps
1. Polish and UX Improvements
   - Add SWR caching for data fetching
   - Enhance loading states across all actions
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Add success/error toasts
   - Add optimistic updates

2. Advanced Features
   - Implement advanced filtering options
   - Add bulk actions support
   - Add analytics and monitoring

### Technical Notes
- Using canvas-confetti for success animations
- Configured with optimal settings for visual appeal:
  - 200 particles
  - Multiple burst patterns
  - Dynamic spread and velocity
  - Bottom-up origin point
- Using Zod for URL parameter validation
- Implemented async URL updates with loading states
- Added error boundaries for filter operations
- Enhanced type safety throughout

### Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: Managing multiple loading states
  - Solution: Created separate loading states per filter operation
  - Solution: Added cleanup in error handlers

- Challenge: URL parameter validation
  - Solution: Added Zod schemas for validation
  - Solution: Implemented fallback values for invalid parameters

### Code Quality
- Added TypeScript interfaces for all new components
- Maintained consistent error handling
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Followed project naming conventions

## 2024-12-19
- Added confetti effect for successful project creation
- Implemented company selection in project forms
- Added project filtering by status, company, and search
- Fixed loading states and error handling
- Added retry logic for failed operations
- Added error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Added proper form validation
- Added keyboard navigation support
- Added success/error toasts for all actions
- Added optimistic updates for better UX
- Added URL-based filter state management

### Known Issues
1. Calendar/date picker components have z-index and event propagation issues in modals:
   - Calendar appears behind modal overlay
   - Clicks on calendar are intercepted by modal
   - Need to investigate proper z-index management for shadcn components
   - Consider alternative date picker implementation if issues persist

### Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix calendar UI issues across the app
2. Implement advanced filtering features:
   - Date range filters
   - Tag-based filtering
3. Add bulk actions for project management
4. Add project analytics and insights

### Technical Debt
1. Calendar component integration needs improvement
2. Consider refactoring modal and popover z-index management
3. Add more comprehensive test coverage
4. Document component architecture and interactions
