# Project Management Feature Development Log

## 2024-12-18

### Database and API Layer Implementation 

#### Database Layer
1. Created project table schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`
   - Added required fields: name, userId, status, startDate
   - Added optional fields: description, companyId, endDate
   - Added timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt

2. Implemented project queries in `lib/db/projects/queries.ts`
   - Created CRUD operations with user ownership checks
   - Added company relationship handling
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation

3. Added comprehensive test suite in `test/db/projects/queries.test.ts`
   - Covered all query functions
   - Added edge cases and validation tests
   - Ensured proper user ownership checks

#### API Layer
1. Implemented main project routes in `app/api/projects/route.ts`
   - GET: List user's projects
   - POST: Create new project with validation
   - Added proper error handling and status codes
   - Matched companies route pattern for consistency

2. Implemented project-specific routes in `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`
   - GET: Fetch project details
   - PUT: Update project with validation
   - DELETE: Remove project with ownership check
   - Added proper error responses and status codes

3. Added API test suite in `test/api/projects/route.test.ts`
   - Covered all endpoints and methods
   - Added validation test cases
   - Ensured proper error handling
   - Fixed request handling and response format

### Next Steps
1. Begin UI implementation
   - Create project list component
   - Add project creation modal
   - Implement project detail view

2. Add integration with brags
   - Add project selector to brag creation
   - Update brag list with project filter

3. Add polish features
   - Loading states
   - Success/error toasts
   - Optimistic updates

### Phase 1: Database and API Layer
- ✅ Completed database schema and queries
- ✅ Implemented API routes with proper validation
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Added type definitions in `lib/db/types.ts`

### Phase 2: Core UI Components
- ✅ Created form components:
  - `project-form.tsx`: Form with validation, company selector, status selector, and date pickers
  - `project-dialog.tsx`: Modal wrapper for create/edit modes
- ✅ Created list components:
  - `project-list.tsx`: Table view with sorting, empty state, and loading state
  - `project-actions.tsx`: Edit/delete actions with confirmation
  - `project-list-skeleton.tsx`: Loading placeholder

Key Features Added:
1. Project Form:
   - Validation using Zod
   - Company selection integration
   - Status selection with predefined options
   - Date range selection with validation
   - Proper error handling and loading states

2. Project List:
   - Sortable table view
   - Status badges with color coding
   - Company name display
   - Date formatting
   - Empty state with call-to-action
   - Loading skeleton
   - Animated transitions

3. Project Actions:
   - Dropdown menu for actions
   - Delete confirmation dialog
   - Loading states for actions

### Added Filter Loading States and Error Handling
- Enhanced `useProjectFilters` hook with loading states
  - Added `FilterLoadingStates` interface
  - Implemented async filter operations
  - Added error handling with loading cleanup
  - Added URL parameter validation

- Updated `ProjectFilters` component
  - Added loading spinners
  - Added disabled states
  - Improved visual feedback
  - Enhanced accessibility

### Next Steps
- Create comprehensive test suite
  - Unit tests for filter hook
  - Loading state tests
  - URL parameter validation tests
  - Integration tests for filter components

### Technical Notes
- Using Zod for URL parameter validation
- Implemented async URL updates with loading states
- Added error boundaries for filter operations
- Enhanced type safety throughout

### Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: Managing multiple loading states
  - Solution: Created separate loading states per filter operation
  - Solution: Added cleanup in error handlers

- Challenge: URL parameter validation
  - Solution: Added Zod schemas for validation
  - Solution: Implemented fallback values for invalid parameters

### Code Quality
- Added TypeScript interfaces for all new components
- Maintained consistent error handling
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Followed project naming conventions
