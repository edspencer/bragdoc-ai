# Impact Feature Implementation Log

## 2024-12-21 12:43-12:46 EST - Database Schema Changes

### Changes Made
1. Added new fields to Achievement table in `lib/db/schema.ts`:
   - `impact`: integer field (default: 2)
   - `impactSource`: varchar enum ['user', 'llm'] (default: 'llm')
   - `impactUpdatedAt`: timestamp field (default: now)

2. Created migration file `20241221_add_impact_fields.sql` with:
   - Added impact column with check constraint (1-3)
   - Added impact_source column with enum check
   - Added impact_updated_at column with default timestamp

### Technical Notes
- Initially attempted to use Drizzle's check constraint, but moved it to SQL migration instead
- Used existing schema patterns for consistency
- Migration successfully applied using `pnpm db:push`

## 2024-12-21 12:46-12:47 EST - UI Component Implementation

### Changes Made
1. Created `components/ui/impact-rating.tsx`:
   - Three-star rating component using Lucide icons
   - Tooltip showing impact level description and metadata
   - Support for both user and LLM-defined ratings
   - Proper TypeScript types and React props
   - Accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
   - Tailwind styling consistent with project

### Technical Notes
- Used shadcn's Tooltip component for hover descriptions
- Implemented optimistic UI updates
- Added visual distinction between user and LLM scores
- Included proper TypeScript types and React patterns
- Added data-testid attributes for testing

## 2024-12-21 12:48-12:49 EST - TypeScript Fixes

### Changes Made
1. Fixed ImpactRating component props interface:
   - Changed from HTMLAttributes to ComponentPropsWithoutRef
   - Added proper type omission for onChange to avoid conflicts
   - Maintained proper type safety for custom props

### Technical Notes
- Used Omit utility type to handle prop conflicts
- Improved type safety with ComponentPropsWithoutRef
