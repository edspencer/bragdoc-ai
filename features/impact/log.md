# Impact Feature Implementation Log

## 2024-12-21 12:43-12:46 EST - Database Schema Changes

### Changes Made
1. Added new fields to Achievement table in `lib/db/schema.ts`:
   - `impact`: integer field (default: 2)
   - `impactSource`: varchar enum ['user', 'llm'] (default: 'llm')
   - `impactUpdatedAt`: timestamp field (default: now)

2. Created migration file `20241221_add_impact_fields.sql` with:
   - Added impact column with check constraint (1-3)
   - Added impact_source column with enum check
   - Added impact_updated_at column with default timestamp

### Technical Notes
- Initially attempted to use Drizzle's check constraint, but moved it to SQL migration instead
- Used existing schema patterns for consistency
- Migration successfully applied using `pnpm db:push`

   - Support for both user and LLM-defined ratings
