# Companies Feature Implementation Log

## Overview
Implementation of the company management feature for bragdoc.ai, allowing users to track their work history and associate brags with specific companies.

## Implementation Timeline (December 18, 2024)

### Phase 1: Database and API Layer
- ✅ Implemented database schema for Company table
- ✅ Created core database queries in `lib/db/queries.ts`:
  - `getCompaniesByUserId`
  - `getCompanyById`
  - `createCompany`
  - `updateCompany`
  - `deleteCompany`
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage for database queries
- ✅ Implemented API routes with authentication and validation:
  - `GET /api/companies`
  - `POST /api/companies`
  - `GET /api/companies/[id]`
  - `PUT /api/companies/[id]`
  - `DELETE /api/companies/[id]`
- ✅ Added API route tests covering auth, validation, and error cases

### Phase 2: Core UI Components
- ✅ Created form components:
  - `company-form.tsx`: Form with validation using react-hook-form and zod
  - `company-dialog.tsx`: Modal wrapper for create/edit operations
- ✅ Implemented list components:
  - `company-list.tsx`: Table view with sorting by start date
  - `company-actions.tsx`: Edit/Delete actions with confirmation
  - `company-filters.tsx`: Filter by status and search functionality

### Phase 3: Settings Integration
- ✅ Added companies section to settings page
- ✅ Implemented data fetching hooks in `use-companies.ts`:
  - `useCompanies()`: List all companies
  - `useCompany(id)`: Get single company
  - `useCreateCompany()`: Create new company
  - `useUpdateCompany()`: Update existing company
  - `useDeleteCompany()`: Delete company
- ✅ Added loading states and error handling
- ✅ Integrated success notifications using Sonner

### Phase 4: Polish
- ✅ Added loading skeletons for better UX
- ✅ Implemented animations using Framer Motion:
  - Fade-in animations for lists
  - Staggered animations for table rows
  - Smooth transitions for filters
- ✅ Ensured responsive design
- ✅ Added dark mode support using Shadcn UI theming

## Technical Decisions

### Component Library
- Chose Shadcn UI for consistent design and dark mode support
- Used components:
  - Form components for validation
  - Dialog for modals
  - Table for company list
  - Select and Input for filters

### State Management
- Used SWR for data fetching and caching
- Implemented optimistic updates for better UX
- Centralized company types in a single location

### Testing Strategy
Decision: Focused on API and database testing, deferred component testing
Rationale:
1. UI is actively evolving
2. Core data layer stability is more critical
3. Components are relatively straightforward
4. Need to maintain development velocity

Future Considerations:
- Add smoke tests for critical paths once UI stabilizes
- Consider adding component tests when UI iteration slows down

## Future Enhancements
Potential features to consider:
1. Company logo upload
2. LinkedIn import
3. Company size/industry fields
4. Advanced filtering options
5. Bulk operations

## Lessons Learned
1. Shadcn UI provides excellent dark mode support out of the box
2. Framer Motion animations significantly improve perceived performance
3. Loading skeletons are crucial for good UX
4. Type sharing between frontend and backend prevents errors
5. Proper error handling and notifications improve user confidence

## Open Questions
1. Should we add company verification (e.g., domain verification)?
2. Do we need more advanced company metadata?
3. Should we integrate with external company data sources?

## Next Steps
1. Gather user feedback on the current implementation
2. Consider adding basic smoke tests for critical paths
3. Monitor performance with real usage
4. Plan future enhancements based on user needs
