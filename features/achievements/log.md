# Achievement Feature Implementation Log

## 2024-12-19 19:28:00 EST - Started Implementation

Starting work on Phase 1: Data Migration & Types from the implementation plan.

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create migration for optional userMessageId
- [x] Create type definitions in lib/types/achievement.ts
- [x] Update schema in lib/db/schema.ts
- [x] Add source tracking
- [x] Create UserMessage handling
- [x] Add migration utilities

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Database Changes
- Created migration to make userMessageId optional (0003_optional_user_message_id.sql)
- Added source tracking with enum type (0004_add_achievement_source.sql)

#### 2. Type System
- Created comprehensive type definitions in lib/types/achievement.ts
- Added Zod validation schemas for API requests
- Defined interfaces for achievement filtering

#### 3. Schema Updates
- Updated brag table to include source tracking
- Added proper enum constraints for achievement sources

#### 4. Utility Functions
Created utility functions in lib/db/achievements/utils.ts:
- createSystemUserMessage: Creates system messages for manual achievements
- createAchievement: Creates achievements with proper source tracking
- validateAchievementData: Validates data consistency
- createMissingUserMessages: Handles migration of existing data

#### 5. Bug Fixes
Fixed TypeScript issues in utility functions:
- Used proper Drizzle query builders with `and()` and `isNull()`
- Fixed null/undefined type conversions using nullish coalescing
- Corrected database query syntax for Drizzle ORM

#### 6. API Layer (In Progress)
Created API route handlers in app/api/achievements/route.ts:
- GET with pagination and filtering
  - Support for company, project, source, archive status filters
  - Date range filtering
  - Proper pagination with total count
- POST for creating achievements
  - Input validation with Zod
  - Automatic system message creation
- PUT for updating achievements
  - Ownership validation
  - Partial updates support
- DELETE for removing achievements
  - Ownership validation
  - Proper cleanup

All endpoints include:
- Authentication via NextAuth
- Error handling
- Input validation
- TypeScript type safety

## 2024-12-19 19:40 - API Layer Implementation

### Completed Tasks
1. Moved all database queries to `lib/db/queries.ts`:
   - Added `getAchievements` with filtering and pagination
   - Added `updateAchievement` with ownership validation
   - Added `deleteAchievement` with ownership validation
   - Added `createAchievement` with proper typing
   - Removed unnecessary `createSystemUserMessage` function

2. Fixed type issues:
   - Updated achievement types to use Zod schema inference
   - Added coercion for date fields in schema
   - Simplified enum validation
   - Fixed type mismatch in update endpoint

3. API Endpoints:
   - GET `/api/achievements` - List achievements with filtering and pagination
   - POST `/api/achievements` - Create new achievement
   - PUT `/api/achievements/[id]` - Update achievement
   - DELETE `/api/achievements/[id]` - Delete achievement

### Next Steps
1. Implement React hooks for data fetching and mutations
2. Create UI components for displaying and managing achievements
3. Add export functionality for achievements

### Notes
- Removed unnecessary message creation for manual achievements
- Simplified type system by deriving types from Zod schemas
- Added proper error handling and validation

## 2024-12-19 19:51 - React Hooks Implementation

     - Create, update, delete achievements
     - Automatic cache invalidation
     - Toast notifications
     - Success/error callbacks
   - `useAchievementFilters`: Filter state management
     - Type-safe filter handling
     - Clear filters functionality
     - Active filter tracking

### Next Steps
1. Create UI components:
