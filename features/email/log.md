# Email Feature Implementation Log

## 2025-01-04

### Initial Setup and Welcome Email Implementation

1. Created email feature requirements document
   - Defined core features, technical requirements, and success metrics
   - Outlined future considerations and planned email types

2. Set up Email Infrastructure
   - Configured Mailgun integration
   - Added environment variables:
     - `MAILGUN_API_KEY`
     - `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` (mail.bragdoc.ai)

3. Implemented Email Template System
   - Integrated React Email for template creation
   - Created modular email template structure in `/lib/email/templates`
   - Implemented first template: `WelcomeEmail.tsx`
   - Added TypeScript support with proper component typing

4. Email Sending Implementation
   - Created `sendEmail.ts` utility with Mailgun integration
   - Implemented generic `sendEmail` function
   - Added specialized `sendWelcomeEmail` function
   - Created shared `renderWelcomeEmail` function for consistency

5. Development Tools
   - Added email preview route at `/api/email/preview`
   - Implemented preview functionality with query parameter support
   - Set up proper HTML rendering with charset support

6. Integration with User Flow
   - Integrated welcome email into user registration process
   - Added error handling for email sending failures
   - Ensured registration succeeds even if email fails

### Unsubscribe System Implementation
- Completed secure unsubscribe functionality using NextAuth's JWT utilities
- Added email preferences table to track user unsubscribe status
- Implemented one-click unsubscribe process with confirmation page
- Added support for both global and per-type unsubscribe
- Fixed type issues with user creation and email types
- Added proper salt handling for unsubscribe tokens

### Technical Details
- Using NextAuth's built-in JWT functions for token handling
- Email preferences stored in PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM
- Unsubscribe tokens include:
  - User ID
  - Email type (optional)
  - Salt for security
  - 1-year expiration
- Added 'welcome' to supported email types

### Current Status

#### Completed
- ✅ Basic email infrastructure setup
- ✅ Welcome email template creation
- ✅ Email preview functionality
- ✅ Registration flow integration
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Type-safe implementation
- ✅ Unsubscribe system implementation

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Set up SPF and DKIM authentication
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add unsubscribe mechanism
- [ ] Set up email receiving capabilities
- [ ] Implement email analytics tracking
- [ ] Add email preferences management UI
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing suite

### Technical Decisions

1. **React Email**: Chosen for its React/Next.js integration and TypeScript support
2. **Template Structure**: Using component-based approach for reusability
3. **Error Handling**: Non-blocking email sends to ensure core functionality
4. **Preview System**: Dedicated route for development testing
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper component typing
