EMAIL 1: WELCOME
Trigger: Day 0 (immediate after signup)
================================================================================

Subject: You're in. Here's how to get started.

Hey,

Thanks for signing up for BragDoc.

The fastest way to get value: install the CLI and run your first extraction. Takes about 2 minutes.

npm install -g @bragdoc/cli
bragdoc login
bragdoc extract --since 3m

That pulls the last 3 months of your Git history and turns it into documented achievements. Your code stays local - only the summaries sync.

Once you've extracted, you can see your achievements in the dashboard, watch them cluster into workstreams, and eventually generate performance review docs from them.

Questions? Just reply to this email.

EMAIL 2: THE PROBLEM
Trigger: Day 3
================================================================================

Subject: The thing about performance reviews

---

Quick story.

Every review cycle, engineers scramble to remember what they did. They scroll through 6 months of commits, skim old PRs, and try to reconstruct their impact from memory.

The result? They undersell themselves. They forget the hard stuff. They write vague bullet points like "contributed to several projects" and hope their manager fills in the gaps.

Managers don't fill in the gaps. They're busy. They have 8 other people to review. They rely on what you tell them.

This is the visibility gap - and it's why engineers who document well get promoted faster than engineers who just do good work.

BragDoc fixes this by capturing your work as it happens. Your Git history already contains the evidence. We just make it usable.

If you haven't run your first extraction yet:

bragdoc extract --since 6m

Takes 2 minutes. You'll have 6 months of achievements documented before your next meeting.

EMAIL 3: QUICK WIN

Subject: One thing you can do today

If you've already extracted your achievements - nice. You're ahead of most engineers.

Here's what to do next: look at your workstreams.

BragDoc automatically groups your achievements into themes. So instead of a flat list of 50 things you did, you get 5-8 named workstreams like "Payment System Refactor" or "API Performance."

This matters because review conversations aren't about individual commits. They're about patterns. "I led three major infrastructure initiatives this year" lands better than "I made 200 commits."

Check your workstreams in the dashboard. If they don't look right, you can rename or reorganize them.

And if you haven't extracted yet - now's a good time. Review season is coming.

bragdoc extract --since 6m

EMAIL 4: CHECK-IN
Trigger: Day 14
================================================================================

Subject: Quick question

Hey,

Noticed you signed up a couple weeks ago. Just wanted to check in.

Did you get a chance to run an extraction? If something didn't work or wasn't clear, I'd like to know.

If you're waiting for a better time - review season is coming up fast. Most engineers wish they'd started documenting earlier. Now's a good window.

Either way, no pressure. Just reply if you have questions.
