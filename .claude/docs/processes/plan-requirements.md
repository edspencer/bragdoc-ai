# Plan requirements

The plan document should be a markdown file named PLAN.md in the same directory as the spec file. It will be read and acted upon by either a human or LLM programmer. Assume little to no prior knowledge of the codebase on the part of the programmer who will be following this plan.

- Non-trivial plans should be broken down into numbered phases, listed in implementation order
- Your output should start with a brief section summarizing what the plan aims to do
- Then there should be a high-level overview of the plan tasks
- If the plan has phases, these should be listed as a table of contents next
- Do not include any time estimates for any tasks
- Each task in each phase should be numbered and have checkbox brackets so we cam mark our progress
- The plan should have sufficient detail such that a junior programmer could be expected to follow it and successfully complete each task
- The plan should aim to reuse as much existing code as possible, so do a thorough scan of the codebase to understand what exists and where to find it
- The plan should assume the developer has never seen the codebase before, so should contain plentiful context about what exists and where to find it
- Specific files should be named, and important function signatures, interfaces and so on defined
- Clearly identify any existing code that we are able to reuse
- If a plan generated a TEST_PLAN.md file, there should be a task in the plan to run the "add-to-test-plan" SlashCommand, so that its UI tests are absorbed into the master test plan

## Documentation updates

Every plan should have a "Documentation" section, which should contain tasks to update our own internal documentation of the app. This section is MANDATORY and should include:

### Consulting the Documentation Manager

**CRITICAL PROCESS:** Planners (spec-planner, quick-task-planner) MUST consult the documentation-manager agent during plan creation to identify which documentation files need updates. Do not attempt to determine documentation needs independently - the documentation-manager has comprehensive context and understands documentation structure.

NOTE: This does not mean that "consult the documentation manager" should appear in the PLAN.md file. It almost certainly should not in most cases. What it means is that the planning agent itself should consult the documentation manager agent in the process of writing the documentation update tasks for the plan.

**Consultation Process:**

1. After drafting the initial plan but before using `/improve-plan`, consult the documentation-manager agent
2. Provide them with details of the planned implementation changes
3. Ask: "What documentation in `.claude/docs/tech/` and `.claude/docs/user/` needs updating for these changes?"
4. Receive specific guidance on which files need updates and what sections should be modified
5. Incorporate their detailed guidance into your plan's Documentation section
6. Each documentation update task should reference the specific guidance from documentation-manager

### Technical Documentation (.claude/docs/tech/)

The documentation-manager will identify which technical documentation files need updates from the following list:

- **architecture.md** - Update for new architectural patterns, technology additions, or structural changes
- **database.md** - Update for new tables, schema changes, or query patterns
- **authentication.md** - Update for auth flow changes or new authentication methods
- **api-conventions.md** - Update for new API routes or pattern changes
- **ai-integration.md** - Update for new LLM providers, prompt changes, or AI features
- **cli-architecture.md** - Update for new CLI commands or configuration changes
- **frontend-patterns.md** - Update for new component patterns or UI conventions
- **deployment.md** - Update for deployment process or environment variable changes

**When to update:** The documentation-manager agent will determine which files need updates based on the planned changes. Trust their expertise and include all documentation tasks they recommend.

### Feature Documentation (docs/)

This should include a potential update to docs/FEATURES.md (if warranted) and updates to any other documents found in the docs/ directory. If we're adding a significant new piece of UI then we should have some document in that directory that describes the capabilities of that UI. There is a high chance this does not exist, so you should create it if not.

### README Updates

Updates should also be considered for both the README.md and cli/README.md files. If it is clear that some or all of our planned changes should involve updates to either or both of these files, include specific tasks for this with specific the content to be added/removed/modified.

## Instructions section in the plan

The plan document should itself contain an instructions section, much like this one. In that section should be at least the following instructions to the programmer performing the implementation:

- Update the plan document as you go; each time you complete a task, mark it as done in the plan document using the checkbox

Add whatever other instructions you think are necessary, to help guide the programmer (which is almost certainly an LLM-based agent). Please thoroughly read the CLAUDE.md file in the root of the project to understand conventions, project structure, and so on, and use that in your own understanding as well as in the instructions you give to the programmer.

## CLAUDE.md updates section

Re-read the CLAUDE.md file in the root of the project to understand if it needs to be updated as a result of this import. If so, add a task or tasks to update the CLAUDE.md file itself. Be specific about what needs to be updated. It's ok if there are no useful or meaningful updates to make.

## After-Action Report Phase

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT:** Every plan MUST include a final phase for submitting an after-action report to the process-manager agent.

### After-Action Report Phase Structure

Add a final phase (or section if the plan is not broken into phases) titled "After-Action Report" with the following task:

```markdown
### Phase [N]: After-Action Report

**Purpose:** Submit report to process-manager agent to capture lessons learned and identify process improvements.

- [ ] Create after-action report using template in `.claude/docs/after-action-reports/README.md`
- [ ] Include:
  - Task summary and context
  - Process/workflow followed
  - Results and outcomes
  - Issues encountered (documentation gaps, workflow friction, unclear instructions)
  - Lessons learned and recommendations
- [ ] Submit report to process-manager agent for analysis
- [ ] Save report to `.claude/docs/after-action-reports/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[agent-name]-[brief-description].md`
```

### Why After-Action Reports Are Required

After-action reports enable continuous improvement of:

- Process documentation (`.claude/docs/processes/`)
- SlashCommand definitions (`.claude/commands/`)
- Agent coordination patterns (`.claude/docs/team.md`)
- Technical documentation (`.claude/docs/tech/`)

The process-manager agent analyzes these reports to identify patterns, workflow issues, and opportunities for systemic improvements. Without after-action reports, the team cannot learn from experience or evolve its processes.
