    <p>You're in. Here's how to get started.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="email-body">
    <p>Hey,</p>
    <p>Thanks for signing up for BragDoc.</p>
    <p>The fastest way to get value: install the CLI and run your first extraction. Takes about 2 minutes.</p>
    <pre>npm install -g @bragdoc/cli
bragdoc login
bragdoc extract --since 3m</pre>
    <p>That pulls the last 3 months of your Git history and turns it into documented achievements. Your code stays local - only the summaries sync.</p>
    <p>Once you've extracted, you can see your achievements in the dashboard, watch them cluster into workstreams, and eventually generate performance review docs from them.</p>
    <p>Questions? Just reply to this email.</p>

<!-- EMAIL 2: THE PROBLEM -->

  <div class="email-header">
    <h2>Email 2: The Problem</h2>

    <p>The thing about performance reviews</p>
  </div>
  <div class="email-body">
    <p>Quick story.</p>
    <p>Every review cycle, engineers scramble to remember what they did. They scroll through 6 months of commits, skim old PRs, and try to reconstruct their impact from memory.</p>
    <p>The result? They undersell themselves. They forget the hard stuff. They write vague bullet points like "contributed to several projects" and hope their manager fills in the gaps.</p>
    <p>Managers don't fill in the gaps. They're busy. They have 8 other people to review. They rely on what you tell them.</p>
    <p>This is the visibility gap - and it's why engineers who document well get promoted faster than engineers who just do good work.</p>
    <p>BragDoc fixes this by capturing your work as it happens. Your Git history already contains the evidence. We just make it usable.</p>
    <p>If you haven't run your first extraction yet:</p>
    <pre>bragdoc extract --since 6m</pre>
    <p>Takes 2 minutes. You'll have 6 months of achievements documented before your next meeting.</p>

<!-- EMAIL 3: QUICK WIN -->
<div class="email">
  <div class="email-header">

    <div class="meta">Trigger: Day 7</div>

    <p>One thing you can do today</p>
  </div>
  <div class="email-body">
    <p>If you've already extracted your achievements - nice. You're ahead of most engineers.</p>
    <p>Here's what to do next: look at your workstreams.</p>
    <p>BragDoc automatically groups your achievements into themes. So instead of a flat list of 50 things you did, you get 5-8 named workstreams like "Payment System Refactor" or "API Performance."</p>
    <p>This matters because review conversations aren't about individual commits. They're about patterns. "I led three major infrastructure initiatives this year" lands better than "I made 200 commits."</p>
    <p>Check your workstreams in the dashboard. If they don't look right, you can rename or reorganize them.</p>
    <p>And if you haven't extracted yet - now's a good time. Review season is coming.</p>

    <p>Quick question</p>
  </div>
  <div class="email-body">
    <p>Hey,</p>
    <p>Noticed you signed up a couple weeks ago. Just wanted to check in.</p>
    <p>Did you get a chance to run an extraction? If something didn't work or wasn't clear, I'd like to know.</p>
    <p>If you're waiting for a better time - review season is coming up fast. Most engineers wish they'd started documenting earlier. Now's a good window.</p>
    <p>Either way, no pressure. Just reply if you have questions.</p>
