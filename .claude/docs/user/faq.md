## General Questions

### What is BragDoc?

BragDoc is an AI-powered platform that helps you track professional achievements and create compelling documents for performance reviews, manager updates, and career advancement. It automatically extracts achievements from Git commits, emails, and GitHub activity.

### Who should use BragDoc?

BragDoc is designed for:
- Software engineers tracking technical work
- Engineering managers documenting team and individual contributions
- Individual contributors in any role
- Consultants and contractors tracking deliverables
- Anyone who wants to remember and articulate their professional accomplishments

### How much does BragDoc cost?

BragDoc offers several plans:
- **Free**: Basic achievement tracking, limited extractions
- **Pro**: Unlimited achievements, advanced features, priority support
- **Enterprise**: Custom solutions for teams and organizations

See [bragdoc.ai/pricing](https://www.bragdoc.ai/pricing) for current pricing.

### How is BragDoc different from taking notes?

BragDoc offers:
- **Automated extraction** from Git commits
- **AI-powered analysis** to identify achievements
- **Structured organization** by projects and companies
- **Document generation** for reviews and updates
- **Searchable history** of all accomplishments
- **Impact tracking** over time

It's much more than a notepadâ€”it's a comprehensive achievement management system.

### Do I need to use the CLI tool?

No, but it's highly recommended. The CLI tool automates achievement extraction from Git commits, saving hours of manual entry. However, you can use BragDoc entirely through the web interface if you prefer manual entry.

### Can I use BragDoc for non-technical work?

Absolutely! While BragDoc has powerful Git integration for engineers, you can manually log achievements for:
- Meetings and presentations
- Process improvements
- Mentoring and coaching
- Strategic planning
- Documentation
- Any professional accomplishment

### Is my code safe? Does BragDoc access my source code?

**Your code never leaves your machine.** The CLI tool analyzes Git repositories locally and only sends commit metadata (messages, dates, authors) to BragDoc. Your actual source code remains entirely on your computer.

## CLI Tool Issues

### How do I install the CLI tool?

```bash
npm install -g @bragdoc/cli
```

See the **[CLI Guide](./cli-guide.md)** for complete installation instructions.

### "bragdoc: command not found"

**Possible causes:**
1. CLI not installed globally
2. npm global bin directory not in PATH

**Solutions:**

**Verify installation:**
```bash
npm list -g @bragdoc/cli
```

**Reinstall globally:**
```bash
npm install -g @bragdoc/cli
```

**Check npm global path:**
```bash
npm config get prefix
```

**Add to PATH (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
export PATH="$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH"
```

Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to make permanent.

### "Not a git repository"

**Problem**: You're not in a Git repository directory.

**Solution**: Navigate to a Git repository:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/git/repository
bragdoc extract
```

Or specify the repository path:
```bash
bragdoc extract --repo-path /path/to/repository
```

### "Authentication required" or "Token expired"

**Problem**: You're not logged in or your authentication token expired.

**Solution**: Log in again:
```bash
bragdoc login
```

This opens your browser for authentication and saves a new token.

### CLI login opens browser but nothing happens

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser popup blocker
2. Local server port (5556) already in use
3. Network firewall blocking connection

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for popup blockers**: Allow popups from bragdoc.ai
2. **Try a different port**: Set environment variable
   ```bash
   BRAGDOC_CLI_PORT=5557 bragdoc login
   ```
3. **Check firewall**: Ensure localhost connections allowed
4. **Try manual token**: Contact support for alternative authentication

### "Repository not found in configuration"

**Problem**: Current directory's repository hasn't been added to CLI.

**Solution**: Add the repository:
```bash
bragdoc repos add
```

Or list configured repositories:
```bash
bragdoc repos list
```

### No commits are being extracted

**Possible causes:**
1. All commits already cached
2. No commits in default time range (30 days)
3. Git repository has no commits

**Solutions:**

**Check cache:**
```bash
bragdoc cache list
```

**Try wider time range:**
```bash
bragdoc extract --time-range 6m
```

**Check Git history:**
```bash
git log --oneline --since="30 days ago"
```

**Clear cache and retry:**
```bash
bragdoc cache clear
bragdoc extract
```

### "API rate limit exceeded"

**Problem**: Too many API requests in short time.

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes before retrying
2. Reduce batch size in configuration:
   ```bash
   bragdoc config set settings.maxCommitsPerBatch 50
   ```
3. Spread extractions over time instead of running all at once

### CLI is very slow

**Possible causes:**
1. Large repository with many commits
2. Network latency to API
3. Processing too many commits at once

**Solutions:**

**Limit commit count:**
```bash
bragdoc repos update --max-commits 300
```

**Use shorter time range:**
```bash
bragdoc extract --time-range 1m
```

**Extract from current branch only:**
```bash
bragdoc extract --branch
```

## Achievement Extraction

### No achievements appear after extraction

**Possible causes:**
1. Commit messages don't contain achievement indicators
2. AI filtering out commits as non-achievements
3. Extraction succeeded but web page not refreshed

**Solutions:**

1. **Refresh web page**: The CLI doesn't auto-refresh the browser
2. **Check commit messages**: Review what was sent
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --since="7 days ago"
   ```
3. **Review CLI output**: Look for extraction summary
4. **Try manual entry**: Add a test achievement manually to verify account

### Achievements are inaccurate or missing details

**Problem**: AI extraction doesn't capture all context.

**Solution**: Edit achievements in web interface:
1. Go to Achievements page
2. Click "Edit" on the achievement
3. Add or improve:
   - Title clarity
   - Summary
   - Details and impact
   - Dates
   - Project/company links

**Best practice**: Review and refine extracted achievements weekly.

### Same commits extracted multiple times

**Problem**: Cache not working properly or was cleared.

**Solution**: Check cache:
```bash
bragdoc cache list
```

If cache is empty, it was cleared. The CLI should prevent duplicates going forward. If you still see duplicates, contact support.

### Can I re-extract commits with improved prompts?

Yes, if BragDoc improves its extraction AI, you can re-process commits:

```bash
# Clear cache for repository
bragdoc cache clear

# Re-extract
bragdoc extract --time-range 6m
```

**Note**: This may create duplicate achievements. You'll need to clean up manually.

### How do I extract achievements from very old commits?

Use the `--full-history` flag:

```bash
bragdoc extract --full-history
```

**Warning**: This can take a long time for large repositories and may hit rate limits. Consider using specific date ranges:

```bash
bragdoc extract --time-range 2023-01-01:2023-12-31
```

## Web Application

### Page is loading slowly

**Possible causes:**
1. Large number of achievements
2. Network latency
3. Browser cache issues

**Solutions:**

**Enable pagination:**
- Go to **Settings** > **Display Preferences**

**Clear browser cache:**
- Hard refresh: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Clear cache in browser settings

**Try different browser:**
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

### I can't find a specific achievement

**Use search and filters:**

1. **Search by text:**
   - Use search bar on Achievements page
   - Searches titles, summaries, and details

2. **Filter by date:**
   - Click date filter
   - Select time range

3. **Filter by project/company:**
   - Use dropdown filters
