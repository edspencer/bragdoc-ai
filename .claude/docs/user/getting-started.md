## Setting Up the CLI Tool

The CLI tool is the most powerful way to use BragDoc, automatically extracting achievements from your Git commits.

### Installation

Install the CLI tool globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @bragdoc/cli
```

Or if you prefer pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g @bragdoc/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
bragdoc --version
```

### Authentication

Connect the CLI to your BragDoc account:

```bash
bragdoc login
```

This will:
1. Open your default web browser
2. Take you to the BragDoc authentication page
3. Ask you to confirm CLI access
4. Automatically save your authentication token
5. Show a success message in your terminal

You only need to do this once. The authentication token is stored securely in `~/.bragdoc/config.yml`.

### Add Your First Repository

Navigate to a Git repository and add it to BragDoc:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
bragdoc repos add
```

This will:
- Detect the repository name
- Prompt you for a friendly name (optional)
- Ask for the maximum number of commits to track (default: 300)
- Save the repository to your configuration
- Show confirmation

You can also add a repository with a specific name:

```bash
bragdoc repos add --name "My Awesome Project" --max-commits 500
```

### Extract Achievements

Now extract achievements from your commits:

```bash
bragdoc extract
```

This will:
1. Scan your Git commit history (last 30 days by default)
2. Send commit messages to BragDoc for AI analysis
3. Extract achievements automatically
4. Cache processed commits to avoid duplicates
5. Show progress and a summary

**Pro Tip**: The first extraction might find many achievements. Subsequent runs will only process new commits.

### Verify in the Web Dashboard

1. Go back to the BragDoc web interface
2. Click "Check for achievements" (if you see the zero state)
3. Or navigate to the Achievements page
4. You should see achievements extracted from your commits!
