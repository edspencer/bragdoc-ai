# BragDoc Overview

## What is BragDoc?

BragDoc is an AI-powered platform that helps you track your professional achievements and create compelling documents for performance reviews, manager updates, and career advancement. It solves the common problem of forgetting what you've accomplished and struggling to articulate your impact when it matters most.

## The Problem

As a professional, you face several challenges when it comes to documenting your work:

### 1. Not Getting Recognized for Your Achievements
You work hard and accomplish great things, but when performance review time comes around, you struggle to remember and articulate everything you've done. Your manager may not be aware of the full scope of your contributions.

### 2. Stressful Self-Evaluations
Performance review time is stressful. You need to write a comprehensive self-evaluation, but you can't remember what you did three months ago, let alone six or twelve months ago. You end up scrambling through emails, Git commits, and Slack messages trying to piece together your accomplishments.

### 3. Time-Consuming Status Updates
Every week, you need to write a "State of me" update for your manager. Every month, you might need to send an update to your skip-level manager. These updates take time to write, and you often feel like you're forgetting important details.

### 4. Forgetting Your Accomplishments
Over the course of weeks, months, or review periods, you simply forget what you've done. That brilliant solution you implemented last quarter? The critical bug you fixed? The process improvement that saved hours of work? Without a system to track them, they're lost to memory.

## Privacy & Security

BragDoc is built with privacy as a core principle:

### Code Stays Local
The CLI tool analyzes your Git repositories locally on your machine. Your actual code never leaves your computerâ€”only commit messages and metadata are sent to BragDoc.

### You Control Your Data
- Choose which repositories to track
- Configure what information gets extracted
- Export your data at any time
- Delete your account and data whenever you want

### Secure by Design
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Authentication via OAuth (Google, GitHub) or secure email/password
- Secure token-based CLI authentication
- Optional self-hosting for maximum control

### Local LLM Support (Coming Soon)
For ultimate privacy, you'll be able to use local LLM models via Ollama, keeping all AI processing on your own machine.
