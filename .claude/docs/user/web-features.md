## Workstreams (Coming Soon)

Workstreams is an upcoming feature that will automatically organize your achievements into thematic groups using AI-powered semantic analysis.

### What are Workstreams?

Workstreams will be automatically-generated collections of semantically related achievements that may span multiple projects. Unlike projects (which are organizational units you define), workstreams represent thematic work patterns discovered through machine learning.

**Example Workstreams:**
- "API Performance Optimization" - achievements from multiple projects focused on backend performance
- "User Authentication & Security" - authentication work across frontend, backend, and mobile projects
- "Design System Implementation" - UI component work spanning multiple product areas
- "Data Pipeline Reliability" - infrastructure achievements across various services

### Key Benefits (When Available)

1. **Pattern Discovery**: Automatically discover themes in your work that aren't obvious from project structure
2. **Cross-Project Insights**: See how similar work appears across different projects
3. **Portfolio Building**: Group related achievements for resumes, reviews, or presentations
4. **Time Analysis**: Understand how your time is distributed across different types of work
5. **Career Insights**: Identify areas of specialization or growth opportunities

### Requirements

To use workstreams (when available):
- You'll need at least **20 achievements** for initial generation
- The AI will analyze your achievement descriptions, titles, and details
- Workstreams will update automatically as you add new achievements
- You'll be able to manually adjust AI-generated groupings

### How It Will Work

1. **Automatic Generation**: Click "Generate Workstreams" to analyze your achievements
2. **AI Clustering**: Machine learning identifies semantic patterns across your work
3. **Named Groups**: AI suggests meaningful names for each workstream
4. **Manual Refinement**: Override AI assignments or rename workstreams as needed
5. **Incremental Updates**: New achievements automatically assigned to appropriate workstreams

### Status

Workstreams is fully specified and planned but not yet implemented. We're gathering user feedback to refine the feature before launch. If you're interested in workstreams, let us know at hello@bragdoc.ai.
