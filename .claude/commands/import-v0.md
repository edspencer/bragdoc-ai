# Create a plan for importing a piece of UX from v0 into our app

Your task is to create a PLAN.md file that outlines the steps required to import a piece of UX from the /tmp/v0-app directory into our app.

## Data you have access to

### Spec file (argument 1)

Most of the rules I want you to follow in creating this PLAN.md file are the same each time, but each time we import a new piece of UX, the specifics are different. Read the spec file argument ($1) to understand what we're importing this time. It will provide you will some or all of the following sections of information:

- Task - overall short description of the task
- Source V0 directory - the directory in /tmp/v0-app that contains the files to be imported
- Background Reading - any additional information you should read to understand the context of the task
- Specific Requirements - any specific requirements for the task

It may contain other information too, which you should pay attention to.

### v0 spec file

The UX we will be importing was generated by Vercel v0, an agentic AI system that builds nice user interface shells and provides us with a TypeScript, Next JS, React, ShadCN and Tailwind output that matches our app stack nicely and can be imported easily.

If the spec passed to v0 to generate this UX exists, it can be found in the same directory as the spec file you were passed ($1), but with the filename v0.md. If it doesn't exist, you can skip this section.

If that v0.md file does exist, read it carefully as it provides valuable context about the aims behind the UX we are importing.

## Your Task

Your task is to use the details in the spec file, read and understand any content it refers to, and ultrathink to create a detailed PLAN.md document in the same directory as the spec file ($1). The PLAN.md document should contain a thorough plan for importing the UX from v0 into our app, following any additional instructions outlined in the spec file.

### Notes

- The v0 pages all have just dummy data, so we need to integrate our real data.

### Plan requirements

IMPORTANT: Our PLAN.md documents follow very strict plan requirements, as detailed in ./docs/processes/plan-requirements.md. Read that file very carefully and adhere strictly to its guidance.

Beyond the normal plan requirements, the following additional requirements apply:

- There should be tasks to copy the new pages into the main app, using the same directory structure

Beyond the normal instructions listed in the "Instructions section in the plan" in the plan-requirements.md file, please include the following instructions in the plan document:

- IMPORTANT: I want you to use the exact UX from the tmp/v0-app pages, don't change it when you bring it in to apps/web.

# Get started

Please start your plan and save it to PLAN.md
