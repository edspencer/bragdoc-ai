# Implement a plan document

You have been given a plan document to implement ($1). Your task is to fully read and understand the plan document, and then implement it. If you were additional instructions ($2), please pay attention to them.

## Instructions

- Read the plan document carefully before starting to implement it
- Update the plan document as you go; each time you complete a task, mark it as done in the plan document using the checkbox
- Keep a LOG.md file in the same directory as the plan document, and update it as you go. This should be a log of all key decisions you make, and any issues you encounter and how you resolved them, deviations from the plan, updated guidance from the user, and so on.
