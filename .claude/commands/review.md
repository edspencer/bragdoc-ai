# Review an implementation of a plan

Your task is to review an implementation of a plan ($1). If you were additional instructions ($2), please pay attention to them. Output a REVIEW.md of your findings and recommendations, and then offer to implement any of them that you think are most pressing (if any).

## Instructions

- Read the plan document carefully before starting to review the implementation
- Look at the non-staged git changes to see what has been implemented
- Please note any areas where the plan does not appear to have been implemented
